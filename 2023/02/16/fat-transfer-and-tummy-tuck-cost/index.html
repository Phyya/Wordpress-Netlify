<p>The tummy tuck cost and fat transfer cost can vary depending on your specific needs, but both procedures have the potential to help you achieve a flat stomach, firm buttocks, and a lifted backside. The fat transfer procedure involves transferring fat from one part of your body to another. For example, if you have excess fat in your abdomen or thighs, the doctor may be able to remove some of this excess fat and use it to fill out areas like your buttocks or abdomen.</p>



<p>The tummy tuck procedure is designed to tighten the muscles around your waistline while removing excess skin that hangs over your midsection. This procedure also helps eliminate scars left behind from previous surgeries or childbirth. The cost of this procedure depends on whether you need liposuction as well as how much time it takes for doctors to complete the surgery.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fat Transfer And Tummy Tuck Cost</h2>



<p>When certain parts of the body lack fat and require additional volume for aesthetic purposes, Dr. Erik Nuveen and Dr. Courtney Caplin,&nbsp;the skilled cosmetic surgeons&nbsp;of&nbsp;Cosmetic Surgery Affiliates in Oklahoma City may recommend fat grafting (also called a fat transfer surgery or fat injections). For this procedure, fat is removed through liposuction or a small needle and the fat is then processed to clean it. Afterwards, the fat is injected into areas like the buttocks, breasts or face. For the face, fat grafting can be used to fill in lines, wrinkles, folds and hollow areas that can age a patient. Since the patient’s own fat is used, the procedure is more natural and produces more realistic-looking results.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">FAT TRANSFER REVIEWS</h4>



<p>&#8220;This has been my &#8220;second chance!&#8221; Thanks to Dr. Nuveen who went above and beyond what needs I could meet to fasclitate the necessary procedures. I came in with several difficult problems that required extra attention. He met all those special needs. He changed my life by at least 10 years, most say 15!!!?? He&#8217;s the most caring and patient surgeoun in the area. I interviewed 7 that have practised 20+ years. Here is where YOU belong. His staff is so loving and kind and check on you walk you through EVERYTHING from day one. Any questions? Answered with concern. Nervous, anxious like me, they are gentle with you. The facility is more like a home setting than hospital, which it is. The anesthesiologist is wonderful, love her. This is more than surgery, these people and, Dr. Nuveen, change lives. Thank you all. Sincerely, Karla K. Strickland. I didn&#8217;t want anyone to see my before, well, they&#8217;ve been seeing them for 58 years. Here&#8217;s how i look 1/2318 vs the New Years Eve 3 weeks earlier. This is why you want, Dr. Nuveen??&#8221;&nbsp;&#8211; K.S. /&nbsp;Yellowpages /&nbsp;Jan 23, 2018</p>



<p>SURGICAL TECHNIQUE</p>



<p>During this procedure, fat is removed from the donor sites via liposuction. An antibiotic solution is used which allows for a complete separation of the fat so that only healthy tissue is used for reinjection. This fat is prepared in syringes and slowly reinstated into the body part where shape and contour are needed. During the injection process, the area will be slowly massaged so the fat deposits settle in compact layers for the best contour finish possible. Normally, multiple injections are necessary to create an even spread of fat and achieve an ideal outcome.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">DURING/AFTER SURGERY</h4>



<p>Fat transfer treatment is performed with general anesthesia when it covers larger areas while local anesthesia or IV sedation is used if the area to be treated is small. Both methods will be treated as an outpatient treatment at an accredited surgical facility. The procedure will cause swelling and bruising on both the removal and injection sites. These side effects will subside in a few days. Recovery time depends on several factors, including how many body parts were involved in the surgery, as well as how much fat was transferred. Scarring is generally minimal with this procedure as the incisions made are just big enough for the cannula to be inserted.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">FAT TRANSFER EXPECTED COST</h4>



<p>The cost for a fat transfer will vary. Again, it will depend on the size of the area treated and how much fat was removed and transferred. For most cases the price is&nbsp;$3,385, and can go as high as $11,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>**Fee&#8217;s that are posted are subject to change. No doctor/patient relationship is established until exam. Consent in perpetuity until canceled in writing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;HOW LONG DO THE RESULTS LAST?</h3>



<p>A fat transfer procedure can give results that will last for years. While the concern of fat reabsorption is something to consider, a skilled surgeon will be able to maximize the outcome by using the tested techniques in terms of fat layering. There is an ongoing research study that promises long-term stability of these grafted fat tissues, which involves Platelet Rich Plasma to enhance fat cells before transplanting them into the body.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;LOSS OF VOLUME?</h3>



<p>When properly performed, a fat transfer can last a long time. In areas where the fat does get resorbed, the area can continue to be tweaked. For patients who want to continue to have volume enhancement, but desire natural results (i.e., lip enhancement), this is an ideal procedure. This is especially the case for those who are not comfortable using an implant.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;WHAT ABOUT SCARRING?</h3>



<p>Scarring is minimal during a fat transfer procedure. Any scars that remain will be small (either where the cannula or the syringe was inserted for the transfer). The incisions are usually placed in areas where they can be concealed by clothing.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;OTHER TREATMENTS?</h3>



<p>For loss of facial volume, there are treatments that may be considered that will also produce positive results. For wrinkle problems, an injectable filler may be suitable. These fillers may include collagen or hyaluronic acid. For long-term results, patients may consider PMMA, an injectable filler that offers a semi-permanent solution. Every option can be discussed in detail during the initial consultation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="section-title">How Much Does A Tummy Tuck Cost?</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>average cost of a tummy tuck is $6,154</strong>, according to the most recent statistics from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. This average cost is only part of the total price – it does not include anesthesia, operating room facilities or other related expenses. Please consult with your plastic surgeon&#8217;s office to determine your final fee.</p>



<p>A surgeon&#8217;s fee for tummy tuck surgery will be based on his or her experience, the type of procedure used and the geographic office location.</p>



<p>Most health insurance plans do not cover tummy tuck surgery or its complications, but many plastic surgeons offer patient financing plans, so be sure to ask.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Tummy tuck costs may include:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Anesthesia fees</li>



<li>Hospital or surgical facility costs</li>



<li>Medical tests</li>



<li>Post-surgery garments</li>



<li>Prescriptions for medication</li>



<li>Surgeon&#8217;s fee</li>
</ul>



<p>When choosing a&nbsp;board-certified plastic surgeon in your area&nbsp;for a tummy tuck, remember that the surgeon&#8217;s experience and your comfort with him or her are just as important as the final cost of the surgery.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tummy Tuck Necrosis Healing Stages</h2>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wound care professionals deal with necrotic wounds daily. We instruct patients in self-care as a routine task in our management plan.</p>



<p>The expectation is the patient will do as instructed and the wound will likely progress to healing. We are aware that the necrotic wound needs to be debrided or “cleaned up” — what we often do not acknowledge is how distressing necrotic tissue can be to the patient. As a wound care specialist, I decided to share my experience with a necrotic wound for two reasons. First, despite my education and training, when my body was involved I did not want to look at let alone care for the necrotic wound. Second, I want to encourage other specialists to be more aware that the patient’s feelings about caring for the wound can affect compliance and motivation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Background</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2003, I elected to have abdominoplasty to address what exercise and diet could not. To prepare for the surgery, I worked with a personal trainer — I followed an abdominal program for 6 months and lost 10 pounds. Although these are accomplishments, people asked me if I was pregnant, something I had heard for 10 years and continued to find rude and upsetting. I went forward with the surgery to put an end to these comments; I cannot express how distressing the question is, especially because I have never been pregnant.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I had been on Nadolol for 7 years for supraventricular tachycardia. Before surgery, I had an exercise stress test for a piece of mind before having anesthesia — my brother had recently had a heart attack at age 54. Imagine my surprise that I could go off my medication. At the very least, the exercise and weight loss at least paid off for my physical health.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Anticipating liposuction, I did a good deal of research before choosing my physician. I asked other nurses about their surgeries and outcomes, assessing patient satisfaction uncensored and literally seeing the results. Once I made my decision, I went for a preoperative visit, asking the usual questions regarding infection rate, surgery failure rate, complications associated with the surgery, anesthesia personnel, and whether office staff were advanced cardiac life support-certified. The physician disclosed that occasional infection was a rare complication. Knowing that not every surgery goes perfectly, I was relieved he was forthcoming about possible postoperative complications. Plus, as I wanted, the surgery would be performed in his office. I believed this decreased the chances of my acquiring an infection compared to having the surgery in the hospital.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Although I had mentally prepared for liposuction, the physician explained that I would be left with the skin causing the distressing pregnancy comment, even if I continued the abdominal program and lost more weight. The problem could be resolved, however, by abdominoplasty. I was agreeable to a different procedure — anything to end the comments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Clinical Problem/Treatment</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The surgery was uneventful. I woke, as anticipated from my training, with two pubic drains. I took ciprofloxacin daily until the drains were removed. Three days post op my drains started leaking. I secured gauze split around the tube but the wound continued to leak through my clothes. I split a semi-occlusive foam dressing to fit the drain site and changed it twice daily, eliminating the strikethrough. The drains were removed at day 7 and I used the foam dressing a few more days until the sites sealed.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Complications arose.</strong>&nbsp;My umbilicus, transplanted as part of the surgery, became necrotic. I found out about it the day after surgery when my husband helped me change my compression garment. Because circulation had been impaired from the edema, my bellybutton was black. I released compression and watched the area. When I called the surgeon 4 days later, he agreed with my assessment and management of the situation and asked that I continue to watch the wound.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Peroxide and polysporin had been ordered for my bellybutton. Although this didn’t seem appropriate, I didn’t want to undermine the surgeon’s responsibility for my problem, so I followed his instructions. Over time, the peroxide lifted the lower edge, dropping my stitches. I could not identify the base of the wound — with my bellybutton transplanted, I couldn’t identify the actual “stalk.” The surgeon didn’t cut it out; instead, he sewed it back down. I have never heard of sewing dead tissue down to allow a “live” segment to continue to heal, as he explained it to me.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp debridement was performed by the surgeon 1 week later with more stitches and Accuzyme (Healthpoint, Fort Worth, Tex.) applied to provide additional debridement. After the second debridement 1 week later, my umbilicus was 70% clean. I continued to use the debridement ointment until the wound was completely clean. The wound healed 9 weeks after surgery.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That was the practical, clinical approach.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Personal Perspective</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Drains.</strong>&nbsp;I was shocked to realize how disgusted I felt when my husband had to empty my drains when we went home. He emptied only one — I took over the task 3 hours post surgery. That, too, was unsettling, knowing it was my body draining. I hated the site of the nasty Jackson Pratt drain cups in the bathroom. This was my bathroom, not a hospital! Yet I teach spouses to do the same thing every day without a second thought. My husband admitted, well after my recovery, that emptying the drains was not an experience he cared to repeat.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Drainage.</strong>&nbsp;The drainage on my clothes, something that upsets me when it happens to my patients, was totally unacceptable. It made me feel dirty and depressed. I had only dreaded the drain removal and that was not as painful as I imagined. I hadn’t considered prolonged drainage. I teach patients to manage drains and to use gauze for drainage. This procedure was woefully inadequate for me and now I realize probably is for them as well. Unlike my patients, I was fortunate to have the access and knowledge to utilize a foam dressing. Presumably, patients must wait to see a professional to better address such problems.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Complications.</strong>&nbsp;When healing complications occurred, I felt betrayed. I had planned this surgery for almost a year and had performed proper (I thought) preparations before surgery. As part of my recovery, I experienced several common emotional phases. I got off cardiac drugs (bargaining). I reasoned that I help so many people who don’t take care of themselves, why should this happen to me (whining, self pity). I questioned whether I was being punished for wanting a surgery based on vanity rather than crisis (faith testing). I even checked whether my emotions were hormone-based (they were not). I considered whether the anesthesia and surgery could affect my disposition when I became somewhat uncharacteristically apathetic and disturbed about concepts of self-care I deal with every day. I know that a patient is physically challenged after surgery and now I realized anesthesia can exacerbate negative emotional responses.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I lied to my husband when he asked why my bellybutton was black (“It’s just a scab”), using my specialist status to reassure him. Inwardly I obsessed, noting the size of necrosis and checking it hourly for a few hours immediately post surgery to make sure it was not necrotizing fasciitis. Although I knew that was not a likely option, my mind was flying with thoughts of potential wound infection. Would the black tissue continue advancing? I could die. Yet I didn’t call the doctor for 4 days because I did not want to deal with the answer if I was wrong, days that could have been critical. Now I have a better understanding about why my patients wait so long to seek treatment. Perhaps, like me, they did not want to deal with the possibility of bad news.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;While using the hydrogen peroxide treatment, I called the surgeon’s office and told him, “Cut out this nasty dead thing or I will cut it out myself!” He instructed me to come to the office immediately. Great, I thought. I can get rid of the sloughy, nasty thing on my body. Then the phrase “leap of faith” took on a new meaning when he decided to suture the dead tissue to my abdomen shortly before I was to leave for a conference. How could I have allowed this? I thought cellulitis would follow for sure. I sniffed under my shirt 20 times a day that week, determined not to inflict repulsive odors on others. I felt completely unattractive, knowing I had a rotten piece of flesh on my stomach. The day after the suturing, the stitches turned pink &#8211; was I getting septic? Thankfully, the erythema resolved in 48 hours and I did not get cellulitis or become septic. This made me more aware of concerns patients may have when we ask them to take a leap of faith and agree to care options they don’t understand. Plus, I was fortunate to have the means to utilize both sharp and enzymatic debridement. Not all patients can afford the options that would improve emotional as well as physical recovery.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>“Walk a mile in my shoes”.</strong>&nbsp;The postoperative experience exposed me to many emotions I did not expect. Betrayal, loss of control, fear of the future outcomes, and apathy were ever present during the physical recovery. My faith was tested in my doctor, my body, and myself as the treatment plan rolled out. I did not like taking care of the wound every day. I felt all of this despite the fact that I should have felt more empowered by my wound care knowledge.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Many colleagues have or had ostomies. I have always thought that they would be the best teachers for their ostomy patients. I hope I can take some of the insight gained from my experience and apply it to my wound care patients — I have learned support, reassurance, and explanation can never be given in excess.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prognosis and Education</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Although some physical scarring remains, I have had a complete recovery. However, as I reflected back on my emotional responses to care, I wondered if the literature supports my reactions. The World Health Organization defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease.”<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The emotional quality of life related to wound care can and should be assessed periodically in the chronic wound care patient. Highly validated tools are available to provide social and psychological measurement in the wound care patient — they need to be more widely utilized. These issues also provide valuable future research opportunity for holistic wound care.</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, I am proof that emotional issues can have a negative impact on a patient even if the final resolution is acceptable and even if the patient is well educated on the risks and skills required for wound management. Sometimes, it is all about the journey, not the final destination.</p>
