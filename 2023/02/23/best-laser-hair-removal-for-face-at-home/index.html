<p>Imagine what your face would look like if you could eliminate facial hair without the pain of waxing and shaving. As a woman who has struggled with coarse chin hair for years, I know how much this would mean to me. Laser Hair Removal sounds like science fiction, but it&#8217;s a real technology that can remove even the thickest beard in just one treatment.</p>



<p>Getting laser hair removal for the face can be a great thing, especially if you suffer from excess facial hair. The problem with doing it yourself is that you don&#8217;t have a device to measure what&#8217;s going on! This article looks at how to do laser hair removal for your face at home.</p>



<p>Read on to learn more about Best Laser Hair Removal For Face At Home, What Makes Laser Hair Removal Risky For People of Color&nbsp; AND Laser Hair Removal And Hirsutism</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img post-id="3438" fifu-featured="1" decoding="async" src="https://cosmeticsurgerytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-9433.png" alt="Best Laser Hair Removal For Face At Home" title="Best Laser Hair Removal For Face At Home" class="wp-image-75327" width="630" height="630"></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Laser Hair Removal For Face At Home</h2>



<p>Laser hair removal is a popular cosmetic procedure that can be done at home or in professional offices. It&#8217;s best to seek out a dermatology office if you&#8217;re interested in laser hair removal, but there are some at-home options available.</p>



<p>Laser hair removal is an effective method of removing unwanted facial hair and other body hair. It&#8217;s important to note that laser hair removal will not permanently remove all of your facial hair. The goal of the procedure is to make it easier for you to shave or trim your facial hair without having to use tweezers or other tools.</p>



<p>Laser hair removal works by targeting the pigment in the follicle of each strand of hair on your body with a beam of light energy. The laser energy causes damage within the follicle and prevents growth from occurring there for several weeks or months at a time. This process must be repeated multiple times before permanent reduction occurs, but many people find it well worth the time and effort involved in order to get rid of their unwanted facial hairs once and for all</p>



<p>Remember, that the number of treatment sessions and the gap between them greatly depend on the following factors:</p>



<ul>
<li>Color of hair</li>



<li>Area to be treated</li>



<li>Hair coarseness</li>



<li>Overall hair growth density</li>
</ul>



<p>We would like to suggest you that in order for the laser method to be effectively giving you best results, you must keep following our recommendations for the length of time between your treatments.<br><strong>How to prepare for the first laser depilation session?</strong></p>



<ol>
<li>Avoid tanning and using sunless tanners for at least a month to prepare for laser hair removal.</li>



<li>Refrain from plucking or waxing your skin. Shaving is fine, but these other hair removal techniques can reduce the effectiveness of the laser treatment.Also, the hair should not be bleached.</li>



<li>Clean the skin at the treatment site.Leave it free of cosmetics, lotions and creams.If you apply deodorant, it will be removed prior to treatment.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Is laser hair removal forever?</strong><br>Permanent means forever. When we refer to permanent hair removal here, we mean no regrowth ever again. Not in one year, not in ten years; not even a single hair to compromise your sun-dappled beach silhouette.<br>Note that this rate of effectiveness does not refer to results after a single session. This success rate can only be achieved after the required number of laser hair treatment sessions.<br>The 10% to 30% regrowth rate is due to those hair follicles that have not been completely destroyed during your laser sessions, meaning that they might eventually grow back. Even so, these surviving hair follicles will usually take some time to recover and you will therefore benefit from a longer period of hairlessness than you would using other treatment methods.</p>



<p><strong>Are there any side effects of laser hair removal?</strong><br>The majority of people who use it find that laser hair removal is safe and well-tolerated. Although laser hair removal is incredibly safe, there are some potential side effects and risks.<br>Some normal side effects may occur after laser hair removal treatments, including itching, pink skin, redness, and swelling around the treatment area or swelling of the follicles (follicular edema). These side effects rarely last more than two or three days. Any side effects should be reported to your practitioner.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-d0809940-bbba-4d44-a5dd-f83c3d0d5a46">Laser Hair Removal And Hirsutism</h2>



<p id="block-340a173f-68c2-4963-91cc-0718d2a3046b">Unwanted hair growth is a common aesthetic problem, but when it becomes an abnormal symptom of an underlying condition like Hirsutism, traditional techniques like waxing, shaving, and plucking only serve as temporary solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-48d06f21-923d-446c-9520-3b9a94aa7bf1">So does laser hair removal work for Hirsutism? Yes,&nbsp;laser hair removal&nbsp;is a viable treatment option for hirsutism patients, on top of PCOS medications and anti-androgens. In this article, we discuss how exactly laser hair removal can help with Hirsutism, and why it might be a better option compared to medical treatments.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-2f09d792-d4ed-44d4-9a44-209b1987dd18">Hirsutism: Everything You Need To Know</h4>



<p id="block-78376c00-17a5-46ff-b5ed-bc9826793759">Hirsutism is one of the most distressing symptoms of underlying medical conditions, causing severe anxiety and self-consciousness particularly in women.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-5879ccd5-c018-47ae-8069-a6cc2b43a298">What Hirsutism Is and Its Common Symptoms</h3>



<p id="block-a085fc89-17b3-4ec8-881b-03fc62d7975c">Hirsutism is a condition characterized by excessive hair growth in areas of the body that either normally grow fine and sparse hair or don’t grow hair at all. This can occur in both men and women, who each have specific patterns of hair growth according to their hormones.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-3fc57720-04b3-4528-b491-3cea6d90d4ae">Hirsute female patients would grow a male type pattern of hair, which means thick facial hair, chest hair, back hair, and inner thighs. Male Hirsute patients also grow hair in these areas, but they are darker, thicker, and coarser almost to the point of extreme body oil production and hygiene problems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-da029273-147b-4e43-af65-445a936b8156">What Causes Hirsutism</h3>



<p id="block-75d24f56-ce14-40df-85cb-a3c35068a631">The first cause of Hirsutism is either an abnormal production of androgens or abnormal stimulation of the hair follicles. Androgens are the hormones responsible for the development of male reproductive characteristics, the most common one being testosterone. This would explain women diagnosed with Hirsutism growing beards and mustaches, or getting deeper voices than their female peers.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-d921c3c2-a02e-4df2-aebb-ab0a044b724b">Another cause is the intake of certain medications like estrogen, opium, and steroids. Some steroids are prescribed by doctors to treat hormonal issues like delayed menstrual cycles in women, but there have been recorded cases of Hirsutism as a side effect of the hormone-inducing compound.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-341a4f48-2428-4b18-a06c-d95e55c9fe40">Other drugs that can cause Hirsutism include the following:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>DIAZOXIE is used to treat symptoms of hypertension and severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar level) following pancreatic cancer surgery. It can cause Hirsutism because it induces enzymes that make testosterone more active.&nbsp;</li>



<li>DANAZOL is a synthetic androgen commonly used to treat fibrocystic breast disease in females and hereditary angioedema. It affects the ovaries and pituitary gland and prevents the release of certain hormones. Its androgenic effects have been known to cause Hirsutism as a side effect.</li>



<li>FLUOXETINE or PROZAC is a drug used for treating depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and panic attacks.</li>



<li>PHENYTOIN or DILANTIN&nbsp; is often used as an anti-seizure medication, with Hirsutism as one of its many side effects.</li>



<li>CYCLOSPORIN is used to treat psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as to prevent organ rejection following kidney, heart or liver transplant. It often causes unwanted hair growth because it stimulates hair epithelial cell proliferation.&nbsp;</li>



<li>MINOXIDIL is used to treat male pattern baldness and promotes growth of hair for both men and women, but excess liquid that runs down on the face from the scalp may trigger unwanted facial hair growth. It has also been recorded to be absorbed by the blood and cause Hirsutism as a side effect.</li>



<li>ACITRETIN or SORIATANE is another drug for treating severe psoriasis with Hirsutism as one of its side effects</li>



<li>STREPTOMYCIN is an antibiotic anti-TB drug with Hirsutism as one of its side effects</li>
</ul>



<p id="block-4f403e52-e031-479a-b482-74d3024feb19">The third cause of Hirsutism is likely to be any underlying medical condition that relies on androgen-stimulating medications.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-332e39d1-7819-4125-8be7-7422465f205e">Among the most common are PCOS, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, compromised thyroid, and anorexia:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME (PCOS): Hirsutism is perhaps one of the most distressing symptoms of&nbsp; PCOS in women, adding to a list of other abnormalities like irregular periods, obesity, infertility and sometimes multiple cysts on the ovaries.</li>



<li>CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA: This is a genetic condition that causes abnormal production of steroid hormones, including androgen and cortisol, the hormones responsible for secondary sex hair growth.&nbsp;</li>



<li>THYROID: Scientists are still struggling to prove how thyroid causes hair growth indirectly, but historically, there is a correlation between an under-active thyroid and abnormal hair growth.</li>



<li>ANOREXIA: Excessive hair growth is one of the body’s defense mechanisms against starvation, which is an effect of anorexia, along with other eating disorders like bulimia.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p id="block-a9fce3d2-9713-4189-a8bb-c36848c32924">Rare cases of abnormal hair growth between eyes or on the forehead is called hypertrichosis, and can be caused by any of the medical conditions mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-f09448da-f8aa-486f-9f44-26ed31c42a1e">There are still some rare cases of Hirsutism that up to now have no identifiable causes linked to them. Hormones are always tricky, but they’re not unsolvable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-b863c368-79fa-4fd6-b489-dd7b2f25cfeb">What Treatments Are Available for Hirsutism&nbsp;</h3>



<p id="block-fb9de835-26b8-48c6-8519-bc00e9960dda">Treatment for Hirsutism is not absolutely necessary if doctors find that it isn’t linked to severe conditions like endocrine malfunction or ovarian cysts. More often than not, treatment of the underlying medical conditions can also indirectly affect and inhibit the growth of hair, but there are other remedies that target hair growth specifically, with laser hair removal being one of them.</p>



<p id="block-f852d516-b45e-4f95-96c0-0ab58a55868a"><strong>1) Medication&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p id="block-9f70b3a8-2dd8-4c47-be2f-85a53298b235">Hirsutism medications usually take up to six months, which is the average life cycle of a hair follicle, before you can see any significant change. These include anti-androgens and oral contraceptives for androgen-caused Hirsutism; and Eflornithine (Vaniqa) cream for women with facial hair.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-fd542e62-a346-4e13-90ec-555568a3047c"><strong>2) Proper diet</strong></p>



<p id="block-8dc4a31c-8225-461f-b3d8-fd75cff02861">Hirsutism in women has been associated with excess insulin in the bloodstream, leading to a spike in circulating androgen and insulin-like growth factor. Switching to foods like non-starchy vegetables, legumes, antioxidant foods, and fruit are good remedies to insulin imbalance. Avoiding fatty sugary foods can also help regulate the production of hormones, specifically androgens.</p>



<p id="block-2249d614-14b0-41e6-8e98-77f387f0726f"><strong>3) Vitamin e and B6 Supplements&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p id="block-6b83e992-fc02-44bd-8ce8-913944dca578">Yes, supplements can go a long way in tempering abnormal hair growth, especially given that it’s a hormone-induced condition. Vitamin E in particular normalizes the production of androgen in the body, while Vitamin B6 reduces prolactin, a hormone that stimulates testosterone.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-52098191-9fa5-4a45-8b41-f456ac133a6c">Some of the richest sources of these vitamins are fish, avocados, organ meats, soybeans, walnuts, peanuts, bananas, sunflower seeds, safflower oil, peanut butter, corn oil, wheat germ oil, and broccoli.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-3fc4fe9c-f405-4114-96ad-f82cc55800f6"><strong>4) Laser Hair Removal&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p id="block-c2ead0a4-90b7-4e0f-a248-0928af412688">If all else fails, cosmetic treatment is the way to go. Laser Hair Removal uses pulsed light to target hair at the follicles and significantly reduce hair regrowth by 90%. With laser hair removal, Hirsutism patients can easily manage overgrown hair without consistent upkeep. With regular use, laser hair removal may also diminish hair regrowth over time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-5a2c8e8e-d486-4fd2-97ae-81d03d565159">Laser Hair Removal: Does It Work For Hirsutism?</h2>



<p id="block-d19f8c04-ab6e-498f-880c-d430667bc62c">Laser hair removal is the perfect resort for Hirsute patients who aren’t fully satisfied with the results of medical therapy. This is especially true for cases that aren’t particularly caused&nbsp; conditions that cause hormone imbalance, or cases that have no identified causes at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-f42c4a17-8ff2-4f69-8e65-463f7a16d5f6">It’s one thing to know that your prescribed medication can help lessen excessive hair growth, and another thing when the cause is unclear and therefore difficult to target. Luckily, laser hair removal doesn’t need to know the cause to get its work done.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-a5ec79f8-643a-48b2-8e61-5adde8c9511f">How Laser Hair Removal Works&nbsp;</h3>



<p id="block-4a39d0e6-f0ed-413a-b385-d7fdd1e2c4bd">The technology used in hair removal by lasers is based on the principle of selective photothermolysis, a very precise microsurgery technique that matches specific wavelengths of light to damage the hair follicles. The “selective” part here means that it cannot affect the epidermis, or the outermost layer of the skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-2103bb9a-32b7-4e8a-88b8-3728616f17b5">During treatment, melanin (the pigment in the hair) absorbs the light emitted from the lasers, and converts that light energy into heat, effectively damaging the hair follicles and inhibiting hair growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-342d9b30-b51d-493f-8ae2-1af4b14559c0">For this to work and yield the best results, the following reminders are advised:&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-1f03b273-45c9-46da-95fd-5551b08cbef1">1)&nbsp;<strong>Take precautions</strong></p>



<p id="block-9079dbc3-214b-44cc-839c-1e93c42e66cd">The cardinal rule to any cosmetic procedure is to consult with a certified clinician first. Whether or not you are a Hirsute with an underlying medical condition, it’s important to make sure that you are eligible for laser hair removal before undergoing it. Certain skin conditions, medical prescriptions, and medical histories can give you higher health risks than potential benefits, so taking the effort to confirm will save you time and worry.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-587d27ea-5a50-4ad8-a5b2-9e2f58406f05">2)&nbsp;<strong>Consider the skin type and hair type</strong></p>



<p id="block-56c8f960-0911-4107-8155-d08487c4484f">Your skin and hair type will come into play because not all lasers work on all skins. Melanin, the pigment responsible for your hair color, is also what absorbs the light energy from laser therapy. This means that darker hair, or hair with more melanin are less prone to burning than red and blonde hair is. This also explains why there are different lasers and different treatment schedules for each patient. Generally, people with hair darker than their skin tone require less treatment time because the laser can easily detect the hair follicles to target.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-e25bee98-cfd1-433a-a440-46c55323a027">3)&nbsp;<strong>Know when to book an appointment</strong></p>



<p id="block-942d1941-a796-4e85-b23c-aa55b744d3ce">Your laser hair removal treatment is best scheduled when your hair is in its active growth cycle, or the anagen phase. At any given time, almost 10%–15% of your hair may be in the catagen or telogen stage, which is why sessions are often scheduled 4-6 weeks apart to allow all follicles to grow and restart the cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-83d2cc70-78c6-409d-becb-40c8be56d3c6">How Effective Is Laser Hair Removal VS Other Treatments?&nbsp;</h4>



<p id="block-1ab55d6a-ef28-45f0-bff2-5e85d217e961">One of the main selling points of laser hair removal, with or without Hirsutism is the little to no risk of irritation or skin damage from shaving, and little discomfort from stubble growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Hirsute patients particularly, the promise of 80-90% of their hair losing regrowth ability may exactly be the result they need for easier maintenance and higher self-confidence.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-b77b521d-ffae-4767-85d0-7f62386c1cc7">How Much Does Laser Hair Removal Cost For Hirsute Patients</h3>



<p id="block-68a20620-217a-44d7-a209-f5f9bdc15cc2">The price of laser hair removal varies widely on the type of laser used, skin type, and medical well-being of a patient.</p>



<p id="block-ea8faf61-8a60-4d36-ab84-0676882c45c1">Patients with light hair and light skin or dark hair and dark skin will usually need a more elaborate and longer treatment plan due to the increased difficulty in detecting hair and hair follicles. Because the lasers need to be able to “see” the hair and selectively burn its roots, the most ideal candidates that need the least number of sessions are the fair to olive-skinned ones with darker hair.</p>



<p id="block-e97fcf07-7c68-47f4-a5f7-89ab1f8e99cb">According to the&nbsp;American Society of Plastic Surgeons, one session of laser removal can fall anywhere between $250 to $600, depending on the size of the area being treated.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-46d73b53-79f7-4f3b-b67f-77ac05614773">Collecting the estimates from this study will produce this list of price ranges per session:</p>



<ul>
<li>half legs – $250 to $650</li>



<li>half arms – $250 to $650</li>



<li>bikini area (regular) – $150 to $450</li>



<li>bikini area (Brazilian) – $250 to $500</li>



<li>upper lip – $100 to 300</li>



<li>full face – $250 to 650</li>



<li>underarms – $150 to $250</li>



<li>chest – $150 to $450</li>



<li>back – $300 to $400</li>
</ul>



<p id="block-5995c68c-efae-49bb-aa7f-0774ae2d554e">On average, most treatments are finished within 3-6 sessions, but patients with Hirsutism usually require more, especially when targeting larger areas like the back or areas with fine or wisps of hair like the cheeks and upper lip.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-f9ab479e-d769-459c-96f3-4f90838b8739">Things To Consider Before Booking An Appointment&nbsp;</h2>



<p id="block-a7965938-cc22-4f6b-a09b-a2dde0555621">Hirsute Patients have many things to consider before booking an appointment for a laser hair removal service. Usually, med spas that do offer it are licensed to conduct various hormonal tests, especially for testosterone levels, as these may influence the patient’s response to laser therapy.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-7c48792c-3bf5-4e59-9371-1d8697c4b7ca">Some of the underlying medical conditions behind Hirsutism like PCOS, thyroid dysfunctions, and adrenal hyperplasias may also affect the longevity of the results and therefore the total number of treatments needed, but not significantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-ee9629b2-ddaa-45cd-8ebf-89449f74eb22">Finally, the price of a laser hair removal session largely depends on the lasers being used. More than 15 laser systems are FDA-approved and commercially available in most cosmetics clinics today. Each of them (ruby, alexandrite, diode, Q-switched and long-pulsed neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet, and intense pulsed light sources), with their own depth of penetration and wavelengths. People with Hirsutism usually need either alexandrite and diode laser systems, and in some cases, a combination of both. These are also the most expensive lasers in the market.</p>



<p id="block-b3610059-ded1-405f-969b-0ebe6da83e97">For those eligible for and interested in the treatment, you can expect to spend $300 per session and several thousand dollars in total. But because treatments are spread a number of weeks apart, usually payments can also be done in increments. Certain med spas even offer discounts for clients that can pay for several sessions at once, or opt for multiple areas in one session.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-94ee1aa1-c2a1-40c1-a2b3-bd44c9f7bee4">When you consider the costs of minimizing hair growth and eliminating the need for routinely wax sessions or new blades, laser hair removal is right on par.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-62a52e6f-3343-464a-92b9-85d604b8f8a3">Being smooth and hairless is a universal beauty standard that can easily be achieved through&nbsp;laser hair removal. However, Indians and other people of color have a difficult time finding a laser hair removal device that can work safely and effectively for their darker skin tones.</p>



<p id="block-25b3b443-1be5-455b-afc4-a63dee6c370c">So which laser hair removal option is best suited for Indian skin?&nbsp;<strong>The most appropriate laser type Indian patients should use is an Nd:YAG laser. As one of the latest lasers available in the market today, the Nd:YAG can work on a wide range of skin types and remove very thick, unwanted hairs.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cosmeticsurgerytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-1744.png" alt="" class="wp-image-113214"></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-dfb93a64-0c69-4917-8021-7de26161f65c">What Makes Laser Hair Removal Risky For People of Color&nbsp;</h2>



<p id="block-ad2d5396-2c47-4cb2-8b1b-a321278c505b">In the past, laser hair removal was inaccessible for men and women of color because of how laser removal technology worked. The earliest laser types like ruby and alexandrite lasers were ineffective and harmful when used on patients with darker skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-9a1a3b6f-8fea-4bf4-9578-612b0aa29226">Laser hair removal works by targeting the melanin in hair. Melanin is what gives hair its pigment; the darker the hair, the more melanin it contains. When the lasers beam light on the hair follicle, the melanin absorbs the light and transforms it into heat. This heat is responsible for destroying the hair growth center in the follicle.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-e4832699-501c-45e9-80a0-0e0887b48853">Older laser models could focus on the “bullseye” and remove unwanted hairs more accurately only when there is a contrast between dark skin and light hair. However, this made laser hair removal dangerous for tanned or darker-skinned patients, as their skin contained a high concentration of melanin as well.</p>



<p id="block-b89b8e76-acfd-46ea-b39b-79838c75bfb4">Because outdated laser models could not distinguish between pigment in skin and hair, they presented a risk to dark skinned patients. These risks include hyperpigmentation, burns, blisters, scarring, and spots in the skin around the follicle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Indian patients have medium to darker colored skin and dark, thick hair, they would need to find a clinic that has invested in the right type of equipment. The laser their provider uses should be able to differentiate between the hair and skin. As darker skin requires cooling in between beams, the laser should come with a cooling function as well. These factors would make the procedure more comfortable for Indian patients.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-5ed33f9c-acdf-4fe1-944e-fb4547b80fb3">Which Type of Laser Hair Removal Tool Is Best For Indian Skin?&nbsp;</h2>



<p id="block-e2ccca22-b7ce-42d5-ab76-b5061d48e468">Patients with darker skin tones have very sensitive skin. As Indian skin tones range from lighter olive to darker shades, it’s especially crucial to identify the specific laser that can work safely and effectively for each patient. There are two types of laser that work for darker skin and dark hair:&nbsp;<strong>diode and Nd:YAG.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p id="block-287e92e1-cc49-45d8-98e3-bcc0ab490095">The diode laser is good at treating thicker, coarser hair compared to the Nd:YAG. Most diode lasers are less painful because they have an instant cooling function that protects the skin from overheating. However, the Nd:YAG is the safest option for Indian patients because it can bypass the melanin in your skin.</p>



<p id="block-b1a45be4-debc-4aae-b896-54e4b0a917d0">The Nd:YAG works at a higher wavelength than other lasers so it can pass through the epidermis and target the follicle directly. Since it no longer targets the color, the Nd:YAG is great at targeting resistant hairs and treating darker-skinned patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-dae34252-5578-4922-b259-eed2909144ff">Do keep in mind that the Nd:YAG may be more painful than other lasers because it penetrates more deeply.&nbsp; It also hasn’t been around as long as other FDA-approved lasers so you may have trouble finding a provider who uses this type of laser.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-694533d0-34a8-46fd-bce3-ce16cd5560d2">Should You Try At-Home Laser Removal Devices?&nbsp;</h2>



<p id="block-5d329b1b-0991-43e3-bd43-b77765cac4a2">There are a lot of at-home devices and laser kits available in the market but they are not recommended for Indian patients. Most of these products are safer for lighter skin types as they have shorter wavelengths. For Indian skin and hair, these short wavelengths are neither safe nor effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-5f333946-cc67-494c-8b0a-b03dcc8e1d3a">Many home laser kits also include screening questionnaires to check if the device can be used on particular hair and skin types &#8212; but most Indian patients will not be able to pass this test. For patients who do meet the criteria, they may find that the results are not satisfactory as the power of a home laser won’t be strong enough to remove thicker hairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-4960fd66-ab29-4ba2-87d7-ce12b5b3dab7">Although laser hair removal can be costly, letting an experienced, certified provider will save you money and time in the long run.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-85d9d78f-cdc8-41a4-9e81-b98a515d0cc9">The Ideal Candidate For Laser Hair Removal&nbsp;</h2>



<p id="block-2282e398-5f64-4cdc-a460-5172acee0560">Historically, people with dark hair and fair skin were ideal choices for professional laser hair removal. Advancements in technology have challenged this standard and many people with various skin and hair types can now undergo laser hair removal treatments. Patients who have met the following criteria are most likely suitable candidates for laser hair removal:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>
<strong>Individuals who aren’t pregnant or nursing:&nbsp;</strong>Pregnant and nursing women should postpone their laser hair removal plans for the safety of the child. While no one can say for sure if any harm will happen to the baby, it’s better to exercise caution.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Patients who can withstand pain:&nbsp;</strong>It may be best to reconsider laser hair treatment if you have a low pain tolerance. The process is not entirely pain-free and the laser may feel like a rubber-band snap on the skin. However, most clinics do offer topical numbing cream and pain relievers to keep patients comfortable during the procedure.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Someone who has realistic expectations:&nbsp;</strong>You may be weary of waxing and shaving already but you should know that laser hair removal is not permanent. It’s more like long-term hair reduction because your hairs will grow back slower, thinner, and finer than before.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-ae26aae5-92d7-4e1f-9136-26cfb03d82bc">6 Laser Hair Removal Tips For Safe and Long Lasting Results&nbsp;</h4>



<p id="block-1def736c-202f-42cb-8b14-8be6aeaff07d">After a laser hair removal session, your skin will be sensitive. Aftercare is imperative to prevent any issues and to maximize results. Here are a few tips to follow after getting laser hair removal:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>
<strong>Stay out of the sun:&nbsp;</strong>When you’re undergoing laser hair treatments, it’s best to stay in the shade and out of tanning beds for at least one month. Your skin needs to be as light as possible when undergoing the procedure to avoid developing any irregular pigmentation in the treatment areas. If you’re going outdoors, apply sunscreen that is SPF30 or higher.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Wait 48 hours before working out:&nbsp;</strong>As much as you don’t want to skip your daily workout, you should give your body some rest after laser hair removal. Sweating will invite bacteria to your body and possibly cause an infection or ingrown hairs. Visiting the sauna, taking a hot shower, and other activities that increase body temperature should be avoided as well.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Keep other skin procedures on hold:&nbsp;</strong>Your skin will be highly sensitive after a laser hair removal session, so skin treatments like chemical peels and other laser procedures should be rescheduled for at least two weeks after your treatment. Giving your skin time to heal will prevent irritation.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Avoid waxing or plucking hairs:&nbsp;</strong>Plucking, waxing, bleaching, tweezing, or scratching the treatment area after treatment are strongly discouraged. Removing the hairs by force may reverse the laser treatment effects and cause hair follicles to regrow. While you can’t pluck or wax for 4-6 weeks, you are allowed to shave 4-5 days after your session.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Skip the makeup and skincare:&nbsp;</strong>Cosmetics, deodorants, and skincare products should be avoided for the first 24-48 hours. Your skin will be red and sensitive so strong products with harsh ingredients may irritate it. If you absolutely have to wear makeup, choose mineral-based products and keep it light.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Apply a cooling compress after treatment:&nbsp;</strong>Swelling and redness are normal after laser hair removal. A cold compress or ice can help bring the swelling down. Moisturize the treatment areas with soothing topical products such as aloe vera gel or arnica cream.</li>
