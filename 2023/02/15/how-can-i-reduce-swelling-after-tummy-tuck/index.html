<p>The first step is to keep your head elevated above your heart as much as possible. This is important because it helps to prevent blood from pooling in the lower part of your body and causing swelling. It also helps with post-surgery pain management by keeping pressure off of your incision site. If you have been prescribed pain medication, be sure to take it as prescribed. This will help with post-surgery pain management and reduce any swelling caused by inflammation.</p>



<p>It is also important to use cold packs on the area where you had surgery for at least 20 minutes per day until the area stops feeling like it has heat or redness associated with it. You may also want to consider using a compression garment around this area for several weeks following surgery. A compression garment will help decrease swelling and provide support for the abdominal area while it heals from surgery.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can i reduce swelling after tummy tuck </h2>



<p>Swelling – also known as edema – is perfectly normal following an&nbsp;abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) at our London clinic.&nbsp;It can take&nbsp;6 weeks to recover&nbsp;from the procedure.</p>



<p>After a tummy tuck, you can reduce post-operative swelling and discomfort by:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">STAYING HYDRATED</h2>



<p>How Can I Reduce Swelling After Tummy Tuck</p>



<p>Aim to drink at least 2 litres of water per day to stay fully hydrated. Using a measured bottle can help you to keep track of how much water you are drinking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">EATING A HEALTHY DIET</h2>



<p>Your body cannot heal properly if it lacks nutrients. Good nutrition can help reduce swelling, bruising and boost tissue repair following an abdominoplasty.</p>



<p>Ensure you eat a balanced diet rich in:</p>



<ul>
<li>Protein</li>



<li>Complex carbohydrates</li>



<li>Fibre</li>



<li>Iron</li>



<li>Vitamins and minerals</li>
</ul>



<p>to repair damaged muscle and skin, plus maintain an optimum fluid balance.</p>



<p>A diet rich in leafy green vegetables, lean protein omega 3 and grains is essential for healing and repair.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">REDUCING YOUR SODIUM INTAKE</h2>



<p>Salt – or sodium chloride – causes your body to retain water, leading to swelling. Aim to keep your salt intake low, but do not exclude it from your diet completely, as this can be dangerous. If you have too little salt and too much water in your diet, you could develop a condition called hyponatremia, which can be very dangerous.</p>



<p>The best way to keep your sodium intake low is to avoid pre-prepared and processed food such as tinned soup and sauces, plus crisps and other savoury snacks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">MANAGING YOUR MEDICATION</h2>



<p>Essential to&nbsp;manage pain following a tummy tuck, the appropriate medication will be prescribed by your surgeon before you leave the&nbsp;clinic&nbsp;following your abdominoplasty.</p>



<p>Avoid any supplements which can interfere with the fluid balance in your body, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Diuretics</li>



<li>Caffeine pills</li>



<li>Garlic supplements</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">STAYING ACTIVE</h2>



<p>While strenuous activity should be avoided following a tummy tuck, you should aim to move your body each day, as this can help to reduce postoperative edema, plus decrease the risk of developing blood clots and fluid pooling.</p>



<p>Aim for a gentle walk each day, then ask your surgeon for some recommended exercise following your procedure.</p>



<p>After an abdominoplasty you should completely avoid:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lifting anything heavy</li>



<li>Reaching above your head</li>



<li>Bending over</li>



<li>Stomach crunches or sit ups</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">TISSUE MASSAGE</h2>



<p>Increasing the circulation is a key way to reduce post-operative swelling and tissue massage is the ideal way to do this. You should wait until you are able to remove your pressure garment, as massage will not work on top of this.</p>



<p>A clockwise motion, working in outward spiralling circles, should be used. Ensure there is no direct pressure on the abdomen.</p>



<p>Ten minutes of massage, three times per day, can help to reduce swelling and pain. It may also help to reduce the formation of scars following&nbsp;liposuction.</p>



<p>Ensure you consult your surgeon prior to any form of post-operative massage</p>

<p><em>MC, Age 42, Exeter, Devon</em>,<em>&nbsp;Mastopexy (Breast uplift) combined with an Abdominoplasty with liposuction.</em></p>



<p>This patient underwent a breast uplift along with an abdominoplasty. 1.1 kilogrammes of abdominal tissue was removed from the abdomen along with a further 800 mls of liposuction from the hips and central abdomen. It is very important after this type of procedure not to gain significant weight as any future weight gain will go to other areas of the body including inside the abdomen where it is not healthy to store fat.</p>



<p>Combined with modest weight loss or a stable weight then the results then the results an abdominoplasty will last much longer and will not have any detrimental effects on general health.</p>



<p>Results are shown 6 weeks after surgery.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">“I lost 10 stone in weight after my gastric bypass, I then waited a year for my surgery and it has changed my life for the better.”</h4>



<p><em>MD, Age 50, Torbay, Devon</em>,<em>&nbsp;Mastopexy and Abdominoplasty with suprapubic lift as secondary procedure</em></p>



<p>This patient underwent a mastopexy (breast uplift) along with an abdominoplasty. Following her gastric bypass procedure her weight had dropped from 18 1/2 to 8 1/2 stone, dress now size 6/8. Sometimes it is possible to perform a weight loss abdominoplasty without the need for a vertical scar associated with the Fleur-de-lis procedure as was the case here.</p>



<p>However post operatively there was a complication of a wound infection which resulted in a poor lower abdominal scar and this was revised three months later and at the same time achieving a suprapubic lift which sometimes is needed as a secondary procedure with this degree of weight loss.</p>



<p>The results of this type of procedure are much better when the target weight has been reached and the result maintained for 12 months or so.&nbsp;<strong>Combining breast reduction or mastopexy and abdominoplasty is a big operation</strong>&nbsp;but very possible in otherwise fit patients who wish to have a single procedure.</p>

<p><em>Results shown are six weeks after surgery.</em></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">“The operation has made a huge difference. It is only six weeks after surgery and I am looking forward to getting back to my usual exercise”.</h4>



<p><em>MJ, Age 42, Torquay, Devon</em>,<em>&nbsp;Abdominoplasty and Liposuction.</em></p>



<p>This patient underwent a full abdominoplasty with liposuction. The result shown and scar is at six weeks. The scar can be expected to fade over the next 6 to 12 months. By performing a full abdominoplasty it is possible to stretch the skin which is folded above the umbilicus and bring it down to the pubic area. It depends how much laxity there is in the skin as to the scar position or whether a short vertical component will also be needed which can be useful to lower the longer horizontal scar.</p>



<p>Most patients who undergo this procedure, unless they are very slim, will benefit from some additional liposuction to the central abdomen and hips which can be performed at the same time. It is important to have the operation when you are very near your target ideal weight.</p>



<p>You can see that there is some laxity in the suprapubic area as well. This will usually be improved with an abdominoplasty but if it is excessive then a secondary procedure at additional cost may be required. This can usually be carried out under a local anaesthetic, depending on patient preference, to minimise the cost of this operation. Sometimes an additional lower scar in the pubic area is needed. This is always carried out as a secondary procedure depending on how much elevation of the suprapubic area is achieved with the abdominoplasty. This patient had a good improvement of the suprapubic area and did not need any additional procedures.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">“Overall I am really pleased. I had forgotten what I looked like before”.</h4>



<p><em>LN, Age 42, Exeter, Devon</em>,&nbsp;<em>Abdominoplasty and liposuction</em></p>



<p>This patient underwent a full abdominoplasty with liposuction after a gastric band. Care was taken to avoid the port site in the upper abdomen during the procedure. Post operatively there was an area of wound infection which required some revisional surgery to revise a short section of the scar. At the same time she had a little more liposuction and a suprapubic lift. The scar can usually be hidden in appropriately selected underwear or swim wear.</p>



<p>A Fleur de lys abdominoplasty can also be used in this situation which results in an additional vertical scar which can be unsightly but does help to take out some additional lateral laxity. This will be discussed during your consultation depending on your preferences.</p>



<p>With large weight loss the suprapubic area will generally be improved to some extent, but can still sag down. A second procedure may be needed to address this area either under local or general anaesthetic.</p>

<p><em>IY, Age 43, Okehampton, Devon</em></p>



<p>This lady had a Fleur de Lys abdominoplasty with a vertical scar due to weight loss after a gastric band which is still present. This gastric band port site can be avoided during the operation if care is taken not too perform liposuction or excision too close to the port site.</p>



<p>Approximately 2.2KG of tissue was removed with a further 500 ml of liposuction to help contour the abdomen. These results are shown at 8 weeks when the scar is still a little red and there is still some swelling in the skin particularly above the scar.</p>



<p>This will settle down over the next few months and sometimes lymphatic massage can help speed this process up. A vertical scar abdominoplasty is more suitable for some patients particularly if they have lost a very significant amount of weight and which option is your preferred choice will be discussed at your consultation as to which is the best option for you .</p>

The hips and lateral end of the scar can look rather prominent without this.&nbsp; Mr Oliver will discuss these areas with you to help you to plan you the type of procedures which should give you the best results.&nbsp; This will take into account your body shape and any previous scars you may have.</p>

<p><em>BH, Age 49, Exeter,&nbsp;Abdominoplasty&nbsp;following weight loss</em></p>



<p>Following 10 stone of weight loss through diet and exercise this patient underwent an abdominoplasty with liposuction.</p>



<p>During the operation a further 4.4 kg of abdominal tissue was excised&nbsp; along with 750mls of liposuction.</p>



<p>When surgery is planned after weight loss it is important to reach your desired weight prior to surgery. This will not only help to reduce the risks and complications from being overweight but will also make the operation easier to perform. If further weight is lost following a procedure then this may result in loosing of the skin and the potential need for a further adjustment procedure.&nbsp; So the general principle is to have surgery at your target weight and not before to achieve the best results. This can be discussed at your consultation which can take place towards the end of the weight loss process.</p>

All scars can be expected to fad over the next twelve months and the lower horizontal scar can usually be hidden under board shorts on the beach.&nbsp; The incision just around the edge of the umbilicus is generally well concealed with time.</p>

<p>The abdominal skin excess was then excised weighing a further &nbsp;1.4 Kg. The scars are still a little red but can be expected to fade over the next 12 months.

<p>Liposuction is usually needed with an abdominoplasty to reduce the hip area and to help contour the lateral ends of the incisions.&nbsp; Generally most people will also have a little central fat in the abdomen and this needs to be removed to achieve a smooth contour around the umbilicus. The underlying abdominal wall has also been tightened which can often be a little lax after pregnancy.</p>

</div>


<p>It is only natural when you put on or lose weight, whether it’s simply due to lifestyle choices, pregnancy, or puberty that your skin stretches with those changes. A&nbsp;tummy tuck&nbsp;procedure can fix that for you.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, quickly gaining weight can lead to the development of stretch marks, while rapid weight loss will often leave you with excess loose skin.</p>



<p>If you find yourself in either position and are feeling self-conscious about your body, we can help with a tummy tuck, a cosmetic procedure that normally involves removing excess skin, fat and tightening your abdominal muscles to give you a flatter and more attractive tummy.</p>



<p>But you may first want to know what a tummy tuck is and how much tummy tucks cost. Let’s explain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Much Does A Tummy Tuck Cost (UK)?</h2>



<p>One of your main concerns when dividing whether or not a tummy tuck is right for you is the price of the treatment.</p>



<p>The good news is that although it is not a small investment, a tummy tuck may not cost quite as much as you imagined.</p>



<p><strong>So, how much is a Tummy Tuck?</strong></p>



<p>In the UK, for a Tummy Tuck (abdominoplasty) you can expect to pay anything from £5,000 to £9,000, and sometimes they can even cost over £10,000 (depending on the individual and work needed).</p>



<p>The reason we can only give you a guide price range is that each case is unique and different and therefore tummy tuck surgery comes with a different cost.</p>



<p>Many factors need to be taken into consideration and the only way you can get a more accurate price for the procedure is by booking a consultation appointment and speaking to an expert surgeon in our London clinic (or multiple private clinics across the UK).</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is A Tummy Tuck?</h2>



<p>A tummy tuck often referred to as an abdominoplasty, is a type of cosmetic surgery that is designed to improve the appearance and shape of your abdomen.</p>



<p>This normally includes the removal of excess skin that has become loose and lifeless, fat, stretch marks and having your abdominal muscles tightened.</p>



<p>This is generally seen as the best course of action if you cannot make the necessary changes to how your body and tummy look through just healthy eating and exercise.</p>



<p>There are several different options when it comes to choosing the type of abdominoplasty that is right for you :</p>



<p><strong>Full abdominoplasty</strong>&nbsp;– best if you have lots of excess skin that needs to be removed</p>



<p><strong>Mini abdominoplasty</strong>&nbsp;– ideal if you only have a&nbsp;small&nbsp;amount of excess skin that needs to be removed</p>



<p><strong>Endoscopic abdominoplasty</strong>&nbsp;– the procedure you need if you are looking to have your abdominal muscles tightened.</p>



<p>Your plastic surgeon can advise which is the best option to remove any excess skin or remaining skin.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What Does Tummy Tuck Surgery Involve?</h3>



<p>The team here at Linia know how nervous you may feel with the prospect of going under the knife, which is why we want to help you understand exactly what happens during an abdominoplasty.</p>



<p>First, we will focus on a standard or full tummy tuck, before discussing a mini tummy tuck. Before the surgeon begins the procedure, you will be given a general anaesthetic so that you are put to sleep.</p>



<p>Once you are under and relaxed, the surgeon will start by making a careful cut from one hip to the other, following what is known as the bikini line on females, which is the line that runs above your pubic area.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.liniacosmeticsurgery.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Linia-Cos-Blog-Image-Template-3.jpg" alt="woman after having tummy tuck at good price" class="wp-image-5894"></figure>
</div>


<p>They will then make another cut, this time around your belly button so that it is free from the skin surrounding it.</p>



<p>Depending on the results you are looking to achieve, how much excess fat and skin needs to be removed and how much muscle tightening needs to be done, the surgeon will get to work.</p>



<p>If you require any liposuction and have opted for that additional procedure, it will be carried out at the same time.</p>



<p>Once the excess skin and fat have been removed and the muscles tightened, they will then pull the skin remaining on your tummy down and make a new hole.</p>



<p>That is where your belly button will go back so that everything is in the right position.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is a Mini Tummy Tuck?</h3>



<p>A mini tummy tuck is very similar to a full tummy tuck, in that fat and skin are removed. However, your belly button will normally be left in the same place.</p>



<p>Generally, liposuction is required as part of a mini-abdominoplasty to help with body contouring.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Much Weight Do You Lose with A Tummy Tuck?</h3>



<p>As an abdominoplasty is not a type of weight loss surgery, but rather, a body contouring procedure, it will not help you lose lots of weight.</p>



<p>It is recommended that you are as close to your ideal weight as possible because the surgeon may not be able to perform it on you if you are too overweight.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What Side Effects Can Arise From a Tummy Tuck?</h3>



<p>As a tummy tuck is an invasive surgical procedure, it is normal to experience some side effects.</p>



<p>Although not serious, it is important to be aware of these so you are fully prepared for the recovery period following surgery.</p>



<p>There will be a scar that runs across the lower part of your tummy and around your belly button, depending on whether you had a full or mini-abdominoplasty.</p>



<p>It is also common to experience the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Difficulty standing up straight. It can often feel something is pulling your tummy down.</li>



<li>Bruising and pain</li>



<li>Numbness in and around your tummy. This could last for just a few months or even years after surgery.</li>



<li>Temporary swelling above and around the scar, where fluid is collected.</li>



<li>Raised and red scars for the first 6 weeks of recovery that will eventually diminish and fade</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What to Do if You Have Complications?</h3>



<p>Although our plastic surgeons are highly trained and experienced here at Linia&nbsp;cosmetic surgery, with any surgical procedure there is always a measure of risk involved.</p>



<p>Some of the more serious complications that can arise following an abdominoplasty include:</p>



<ul>
<li>More obvious and thicker scars starting to develop</li>



<li>Large bulges beneath your skin</li>



<li>Extra skin, often referred to as dog ears, developing around the edges of your scar</li>



<li>Wounds not healing properly</li>



<li>Fluid collecting in and around the area where the procedure was carried out</li>



<li>Blood collecting beneath the surface of the skin (haematoma)</li>



<li>Pain or numbness in and around your tummy or down your leg</li>



<li>Tummy pain or cramps</li>



<li>Breathing difficulties</li>



<li>Blood clot developing in a vein</li>



<li>Excessive amounts of bleeding</li>



<li>Allergic reaction to your anaesthetic (this is incredibly rare)</li>



<li>Infection</li>
</ul>



<p>In the event of any of these complications arising in the days, weeks, months or even years following your procedure, you should contact the Linia Cosmetic Surgery Clinic.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is a Tummy Tuck The Right Procedure for Me (Alternatives?)</h3>



<p>Although the decision of whether abdominoplasty is right for you is indeed a personal one, it is a good idea to get expert help and advice when making the decision.</p>



<p>At your consultation appointment, one of our highly trained surgeons, who will be performing the surgery if you choose to go ahead, will discuss with you your eligibility for a tummy tuck and what you are looking to achieve.</p>



<p>You must keep in mind that a tummy tuck is a cosmetic surgical procedure designed to improve the appearance and shape of your tummy after you have gained or lost a lot of weight and are living with unsightly stretch marks or loose skin. It is not a weight-loss procedure.</p>



<p>Although it is not a true alternative, if you do not want to have the surgery, you may be able to achieve similar body contouring results with just liposuction.</p>



<p>Minimally invasive, liposuction removes fat using suction.</p>



<p>Less invasive still, is our cutting-edge&nbsp;vaser liposuction&nbsp;procedure.</p>



<p>This would be an ideal alternative if you do not have too much excess skin and have localised pockets of excess weight that you are looking to have removed.</p>



<p>You can see the differences here in our guide about&nbsp;liposuction vs tummy tuck</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Who Should Not Have a Tummy Tuck?</h3>



<p>As we have already noted, a tummy tuck is not a weight-loss procedure.</p>



<p>Therefore, if you are overweight, you should not have the surgery and the surgeon you see at your consultation appointment will not agree to go ahead with the procedure.</p>



<p>Not only will you not be able to achieve the weight loss results you are looking for, but your weight could put you at risk and complicate the procedure.</p>



<p>Abdominoplasty is also not suitable if you are currently a heavy smoker or have suffered from blood clots in the past.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is a Tummy Tuck Worth It?</h3>



<p>Again, whether a tummy tuck is right for you if you are a suitable candidate, is a personal decision.</p>



<p>If you are self-conscious and have low self-esteem due to excess skin or severe stretch marks, and it is </p>



<p>affecting the quality of life you have, the procedure will certainly correct those issues.</p>



<p>You need to be aware, though, of the risks and complications and the fact that recovery is going to take a long time. It is not an easy fix and you should expect pain and discomfort.</p>



<p>If you think you can cope with that and are willing to put in the hard work (or rest) necessary to enjoy the best results possible, then abdominoplasty may just be the key to starting a new chapter in life.</p>



<p>One where you are confident to wear that bikini and feel comfortable in your own body.</p>
