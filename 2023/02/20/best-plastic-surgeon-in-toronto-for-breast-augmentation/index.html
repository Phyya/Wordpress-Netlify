<p>There are several different options for breast augmentation, including saline and silicone implants, the use of fat transfer to augment breasts, breast lift surgeries, and other procedures such as liposuction to remove excess fat from other areas of your body. The cost of breast augmentation varies depending on your surgeon&#8217;s fees, but also on what type of implant you choose and whether or not you choose additional procedures like liposuction as part of your treatment plan.</p>



<p>Breast augmentation is one of the most popular plastic surgery procedures in Australia. The procedure is meant to increase the size of your breast tissue. The goal of this surgery is to achieve a more feminine shape without having implants that are too large or obvious. </p>



<p>Read on to learn more about Best Plastic Surgeon In Toronto For Breast Augmentation, Choosing Your Breast Implants AND Risks Of Breast Augmentation</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img post-id="2474" fifu-featured="1" decoding="async" src="https://cosmeticsurgerytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-1411-1024x640.png" alt="Best Plastic Surgeon In Toronto For Breast Augmentation" title="Best Plastic Surgeon In Toronto For Breast Augmentation" class="wp-image-111735" width="761" height="476"></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Plastic Surgeon In Toronto For Breast Augmentation</h2>



<p>Breast Augmentation has remained the #1 cosmetic procedure in North America for many years. Many women intimately associate their breasts with a sense of femininity; An enhancement in breast size, shape and can have a dramatic effect on a woman’s self-confidence. Women seek out a breast augmentation to increase fullness, achieve rounder cleavage, replace volume lost after pregnancy and weight loss, and to achieve overall body aesthetic balance and proportion. Our highly skilled SixSurgery team is equipped with elite technical skill and surgical finesse to ensure that your Breast Augmentation procedure is tailored to your unique vision and is sure to be a smooth process from start to finish.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is<br>Breast Augmentation</h3>



<p>Breast Augmentation, alternatively known as Augmentation Mammoplasty, is a surgical procedure where an implant is placed underneath the breast tissue. A breast augmentation is used to enhance or restore the volume and shape of your breasts. While each body is beautiful in its own right, some women feel deprived of their femininity when genetically predisposed to smaller breasts or when the breast shape and fullness they once had diminishes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The SixSurgery<br>Approach&nbsp;to Breast Augmentation</h4>



<p>Our approach takes half the time and leaves half the evidence</p>



<ul>
<li>2CM Incision</li>



<li>30 Minutes</li>



<li>Shorter Recovery</li>
</ul>



<p>Scarring and recovery time are two significant factors influencing a woman’s decision of whether or not to undergo a breast augmentation. SixSurgery surgeons combine state of the art technique and a unique surgical approach to offer the Tiny Scar Breast Augmentation, which minimizes scarring, reduces surgery length, and accelerates recovery time.</p>



<p>Typically, breast augmentation surgery will leave you with a 4-8 cm scar. This can be a discouraging fact for some women and ultimately deter them from wanting the procedure. The SixSurgery team understands your desire for discrete scarring, and through years of experience and innovation developed a unique surgical solution —The Tiny Scar Breast Augmentation. This technique is performed with a small 2 cm incision for saline implants and a 2.5-3 cm incision for silicone.</p>



<p>The miniature scar is not the only benefit from this elite surgical method. The fine-tuned technique can be performed in half an hour under local or general anesthesia as opposed to the typical one to two hours that a traditional breast augmentation will take. While recovery looks different for everyone, this approach has proven quicker recovery times where patients may return to regular activities in 5-7 days and resume more strenuous activities in approximately six weeks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Am I A Good&nbsp;Candidate?</h3>



<p>A woman may consider a Breast Augmentation for many reasons:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Genetics</h4>



<p>Some women are born with breasts that appear small or disproportionate to the rest of their body. While this is perfectly normal and acceptable, it may be negatively impacting your self-esteem. If this is the case, breast augmentation could be the perfect solution for you.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Breast Deflation</h4>



<p>Breast deflation (loss of fullness) can occur under several circumstances. Some women notice reduced breast fullness following pregnancy and breastfeeding. Other women notice a significant decrease in breast volume after weight loss. Breast deflation and loss of firmness is also a natural process that may take effect with aging. If you notice that your breasts have lost the shape and firmness that they once possessed, breast augmentation can help bring them back to life by adding youthful fullness.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Disproportionate or Uneven Breasts</h4>



<p>You may perceive your body as disproportionate or you find that your breasts appear unevenly positioned.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Weight Loss</h4>



<p>Congratulations! You have made the choice to prioritize your health and get into shape. Unfortunately for many, this also results in fat loss in the breasts. If this has been the case for you, a breast augmentation will allow you to restore your breasts without having to compromise additional weight elsewhere.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Mastectomy</h4>



<p>Perhaps you are a breast cancer survivor and have had to undergo a mastectomy as part of your treatment. If this has taken a toll on your confidence, a breast augmentation can help to be a great resolution.</p>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading">All of our patients must be in optimal health before going forward with the surgery</h6>



<ul>
<li>You must maintain a healthy weight with a BMI of less than 30</li>



<li>You must not be taking an immunosuppressant medication</li>



<li>If you are diabetic and require insulin regulation, we will be unable to perform your surgery in our private facility and will alternatively need to refer you to a hospital based colleague</li>



<li>You must not have malignant hyperthermia</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Breast Implant Decisions</h3>



<p>There are several considerations to be made during the breast augmentation process. While each step will be addressed during your initial consultation, the SixSurgery Team puts emphasis on empowering the patient with the information needed to enhance your understanding of the surgery. Consider your pre-operative consultation a time in which you and your plastic surgeon work together to construct the ultimate plan to achieve your desired result. By the end of your consultation, you will have agreed upon an implant with a specific filler, width, volume, and shape. </p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Catered to You</h5>



<p>Your surgeon will use their extensive experience and cosmetic artistry to help you choose the perfect implant. Some factors which will be taken into consideration include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Body shape and size</li>



<li>Existing (or natural) breast size and shape (breast anatomy)</li>



<li>Desired&nbsp;look&nbsp;– natural or fake</li>



<li>Amount of sagging or drooping (ptosis) of existing breasts</li>



<li>Amount and integrity of natural breast tissue</li>



<li>Lifestyle and physical activity</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">The Current State of Breast Augmentation</h5>



<p>Most of our patients have no problems with their implants and continue to enjoy having the breasts they have always desired. Current generation implants are made from an extremely durable silicone shell to decrease the risk of implant leakage or rupture. In the case of silicone-filled implants, the amount of silicone released across the shell (silicone-gel bleed) is limited to:</p>



<ul>
<li>
<strong>1 Million</strong><em>More than a million times less than established safety limits (based on the results of FDA reviewed studies).</em>
</li>



<li>
<strong>100</strong><em>More than a hundred times less than the amount of silicone absorbed from daily exposure to common consumer products containing silicone, such as antiperspirants, skin lotions and hair care products.</em>
</li>
</ul>



<p>However, if any breast implant is found to be defective (leak or rupture), since all our implants come with a lifetime warranty, you will receive a brand new implant to replace the damaged one.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choosing Your Breast Implants</h2>



<p>The sheer number of breast implant variations available to patients and surgeons can lead to confusion; however, careful measurement, proper analysis of your anatomy, and experienced decision-making can help our plastic surgeons give you the best breast enlargement possible.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, some surgical recommendations are made on the basis of marketing, surgeon habit, or profit, rather than careful listening to the patient’s goals and concerns. As leading Minnesota aesthetic plastic surgery providers, our American Board of Plastic Surgery-certified plastic surgeons and experienced nursing staff help patients choose their breast implants with the benefit of extensive expertise and over 50 years of combined experience with thousands of patients.</p>



<p>Since breast augmentation is performed so frequently at Minneapolis Plastic Surgery, Ltd., we maintain an extensive on-site inventory of breast implants in virtually every size and profile, in both two types of cohesive silicone, as well as saline. Your implants don’t have to be ordered in advance, you don’t have to worry about us having the “right ones” in surgery, and on-time delivery is not an issue—they are already here!</p>



<p>Minneapolis Plastic Surgery’s AAAASF-accredited surgical facility is one of the first in the country to offer a complete on-site stock of Allergan Natrelle Inspira (Responsive) cohesive silicone gel implants in all sizes and profiles. Natrelle Inspira Responsive (cohesivity type 1) are higher-fill implants designed to reduce visible implant rippling compared to the previous&nbsp; Allergan Natrelle silicone gel implants.</p>



<p>MPS now also offers a complete (all sizes and profiles) on-site consignment of Inspira Soft-Touch (cohesivity type 2) cohesive silicone gel implants with even more ripple resistance. In the unlikely event your anatomy requires the even-more crosslinked Inspira Cohesive implants (cohesivity type 3–identical to the style 410 cohesivity explained in more detail below), we can have multiple sizes and profiles of implants overnight express delivered to fulfill your requirements.</p>



<p>Breast Implant Information&#8211;What are the Options?</p>



<p>Types of Breast Implants</p>



<p>Breast implants come in numerous sizes (100cc – 800cc, or about 3 to 27 ounces each), shapes (round, oval, or teardrop “anatomic”), surface characteristics (smooth or textured), and fill material. Most breast implants are filled with saline or silicone gel, and occasionally other materials (though none of these “other materials” are FDA approved at the present time). Silicone gel implants presently come no larger than 800cc, but 800cc saline implants can be “overfilled” to volumes higher than this when requested in select patients.</p>



<p>Since the material inside breast implants is what gives them their “feel,” filler material choices have generated much controversy and media interest, not to mention scientific debate. We can provide both the science and years of expertise to help you determine whether saline or silicone is best for you.</p>



<p>Until March 9th, 2012, only two manufacturers produced breast implants FDA-approved for use in the United States (Mentor Corp., now part of Johnson and Johnson; and Inamed Corp., previously McGhan Medical, now owned by Allergan, Inc.). For the first time in 20 years in the United States, a third company (Sientra) has received FDA approval to sell their Silimed brand of silicone and saline implants, including textured anatomic silicone gel implants.</p>



<p>Prior to the FDA restrictions of 1991-1992, numerous companies produced breast implants with different designs, surfaces, and filler materials, including polyurethane-coated silicone gel implants, silicone-saline double-lumen implants (the Becker implant), and PVP hydrogel filled implants designed to pass mammography X-rays and have a feel more like silicone than saline (the Bioplasty Misti-Gold implant). After the FDA restrictions, these implant options and companies were lost to USA patients, though some of these companies and options remain available in other countries.</p>



<p>In the United States, besides the presently-available Mentor, Allergan, and now Silimed implants, several companies have produced investigational implants that are not yet FDA-approved and are implanted only by plastic surgeons associated with the FDA investigation/approval process.</p>



<p>Silicone or Saline? (How about fat?)</p>



<p>At Minneapolis Plastic Surgery we offer both saline and the latest cohesive silicone breast implants.</p>



<p>Saline identical to intravenous fluid was the most common type of breast implant filler material used in the United States from 1992 until November 2006, when the FDA re-approved the use of silicone gel-filled implants for primary elective breast augmentation. Prior to the 1992 FDA restrictions,and again after 2006, silicone gel implants are utilized in over 85 percent of all breast augmentation procedures in the United States, and remain the most commonly used breast implants worldwide.</p>



<p>Other types of filler material have been evaluated over the years prior to the introduction of silicone gel implants in 1963, and one or more problems are associated with these. Paraffin, sponges, and other unusual materials were used in early efforts to enlarge breasts; results were dismal until silicone came into use in the 1960s.</p>



<p>Though many radiologists state that they can tell the difference between dead-fat microcalcifications (from fat grafting), and dead-fat microcalcifications (from possible breast cancer), many plastic surgeons (including those here at MPS) are not willing to risk your life for a procedure that remains unproven regarding long-term safety, especially since 1 in 8 or 9 women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. And also since implants are still a superior choice lacking these mammographic concerns.</p>



<p>Unless your surgeon uses appropriate fat harvest technique, and transplants the still-living fat globules into carefully-spaced tunnels with tiny fat grafts surrounded by abundant healthy tissue for blood supply, fat damaged by poor liposuction techniques, or grafted haphazardly in big blobs, will not survive. Any breast enlargement initially achieved is gradually and ultimately lost as the dead fat cells are absorbed and carried away by the body—potentially leaving scars, lumps, and calcifications. Pretreatment with Brava suction devices may enhance fat “take,” but at best, most women realize no more than ½ to 1 bra cup size enlargement via grafting.</p>



<p>Breasts augmented with fat grafts that die, calcify, or become scarred nodules within the breast are far from “natural.” And as the dead cells are removed by the woman’s body, the once-larger breasts<br>gradually lose size, making lasting enlargement uncommon. We see many unhappy former fat graft breast patients who return for the implants they should have had in the first place.</p>



<p>The latest marketing “hype” around fat grafting for breast enlargement uses the term “stem cell breast augmentation.” This is the same procedure as fat grafting, but with the possible addition of centrifugation or addition of blood plasma to “concentrate” or “enrich” the “stem cells.” Until peer-reviewed scientific research validates breast augmentation via fat grafting (or stem-cell breast enlargement), this should be considered experimental only! Soft, natural, and lasting breast augmentation is (still) best achieved by skillful placement of breast implants.</p>



<p>Numerous scientific studies were performed during these years of implant controversy, and to date, there has not been one credible peer-reviewed study that shows cause-and-effect relationship between silicone gel or saline implants and any sort of auto-immune disease or illness. Saline implants can leak and deflate, particularly if they are not filled properly, and they have also been shown to have a higher visibility of rippling or wrinkling on the implant surface. This rippling can cause unsightly and unnatural breast appearance, and tends to be worse when bending over or when wearing swimsuits or cleavage-revealing clothing. Implant placement below the pectoralis major muscles reduces saline-implant ripples, and usually eliminates or significantly reduces them when silicone gel implants are used.</p>



<p>Saline implants cost less, and can be inserted via a slightly shorter incision, though we continue to be surprised by the length and position of breast augmentation incisions (both saline and silicone) in patients we see from other practices. Incision length is much less a factor of saline vs. silicone than choice of surgeon. We have also found that the cost differential between saline and silicone gel implants is not always passed on to the patient, making saline implants more profitable than silicone in some doctors’ offices.</p>



<p>Surgeons who tend to promote the use of saline implants may do so out of training, their own experiences, habit, or profit motive, but those who scare patients with (disproved) autoimmune illness association, or tell them of the (outdated) FDA recommendation for MRI scans to check for “leaks” in silicone implant patients (unnecessary for all latest-generation cohesive silicone gel implants), only serve their own interests, not those of their patients. These are old, outdated, and inapplicable “concerns” that have been exhaustively studied and we believe no longer apply.</p>



<p>Leak and deflation of saline implants require surgical replacement (the implant manufacturers provide free lifetime implant replacement, and will cover a majority of the surgical costs for the first ten years after initial implantation). But another operation is needed, including time off from work or social activities, and restrictions during healing. When saline implant leak requires re-operation, most patients choose cohesive silicone gel implants to replace both of their saline ones, ensuring that leak and deflation can never again occur. Significant numbers of MPS patients who initially received saline breast implants have undergone a second procedure (whether they had a leak or not) to replace their saline implants with the latest generation of cohesive silicone gel implants. Rippling is eliminated or significantly reduced, softness and natural “feel” is enhanced, and leak or deflation is no longer a concern. Many also use this opportunity to choose a larger size. Whatever the reason, and despite the fact that many happy saline implant patients remain without concerns and with excellent results, a majority of our patients now choose silicone gel implants.</p>



<p>The newest generation of cohesive silicone breast implants provides incredibly natural-looking and feeling results, and also a high level of safety. The latest types of silicone gel breast implants have been used as part of the more general FDA study since 1992, and are soft, yet still a cohesive solid gel that cannot leak. These implants do not leak even if the shell is cut or punctured, and can be inserted via a 1.5 inch incision. Slicing open one of this latest generation of breast implants is like cutting Jell-O—you get two solid intact parts and leakage does not occur. (These implants are often erroneously called “gummy bear” implants since they are cohesive, though the true first “gummy bear” implants were the Allergan style 410s.)</p>



<p>Now that a third implant manufacturer (Sientra) is producing implants that are FDA-approved for use in this country, additional options exist for patient and surgeon choice. Sientra markets their version of high-strength cohesive silicone gel implants (smooth, round, textured, and teardrop-shaped) as “gummy bear” implants, further confusing this designation, which should probably be abandoned since it no longer describes a single type (or company’s) implants! Sientra has decided to sell their products only to American Board of Plastic Surgery-certified plastic surgeons (a laudable position), whereas Mentor and Allergan will sell their implants to any licensed physician, regardless of specialty. (This is how Dermatologists, Family Practitioners, and doctors with little or no plastic surgical training can legally obtain breast implants, and insert them into unwitting patients who think that these “cosmetic surgeons” have the same training and certification as ABPS-certified plastic surgeons.) Whether or not this will confer better statistics, outcome studies, or lower complication rates than the other companies’ practices remains to be seen.</p>



<p>With silicone gel or saline breast implants, microscopic silicone molecules can still enter a patient’s body, just as liquid silicone does in the patient who has an injection with a needle lubricated with liquid silicone. No scientific study to date has provided credible evidence that silicone has any cause-and-effect relationship with autoimmune diseases or conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, or so-called “human adjuvant illnesses.” With these studies in mind, silicone gel breast implants were FDA-approved in November 2006 for elective first-time cosmetic breast enlargement in women over the age of 22. Use of silicone gel implants in women under age 22 is considered “off-label” use and is perfectly legal. We support the right of properly-informed women between the ages of 18 and 22 to consent to and request the implants of their choice, including silicone gel implants.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Risks Of Breast Augmentation</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://centreforsurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/breast-augmentation-risks.jpeg" alt="breast augmentation risks"></figure>



<p>When carried out by an expert plastic surgeon,&nbsp;breast augmentation&nbsp;is a very safe procedure with minimal risk of complications. Any type of surgery carries certain risks, and breast augmentation is no different. Your surgeon will discuss the risks and potential complications of breast augmentation at your consultation. This will allow you to weigh up the pros and cons of the procedure before making your decision.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some of the risks of breast augmentation include (but are not limited to):</h3>



<ul>
<li>Anaesthesia-related complications such as anaphylaxis</li>



<li>Excessive bleeding</li>



<li>Wound infection</li>



<li>Post-operative haematoma formation</li>



<li>Seromas</li>



<li>Implant malposition</li>



<li>Change in nipple sensitivity</li>



<li>Capsular contracture – formation of excessive scar tissue around the implant</li>



<li>Implant rupture</li>



<li>Breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL)</li>



<li>Excessive pain that does not improve over the first two weeks</li>



<li>Need for revision surgery</li>
</ul>



<p>It is essential to bear in mind that many of these risks are very rare. In contrast, others, such as haematoma formation, can be easily managed by a washout procedure with the preservation of the breast implant.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Breast augmentation risks</h4>



<p>Breast implants must be approved by the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (MHRA) before they are suitable for use in the UK. We also use FDA-approved implants. This means the implants have been shown to be safe and effective. The vast majority of breast augmentation patients do not develop serious complications during or after their procedure.</p>



<p>Several key risks should be borne in mind when considering breast augmentation. Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a severe complication of breast augmentation. However, it is extremely rare, with only a handful of cases reported worldwide out of millions of procedures performed. Breast implant illness is a condition some patients believe is due to breast implants. Patients may complain of the following symptoms:</p>



<ul>
<li>Excessive fatigue</li>



<li>Generalised muscle and joint pains</li>



<li>Skin rashes</li>



<li>Cognitive impairment or ‘brain fog.’</li>
</ul>



<p>If complications occur after breast augmentation, we would advise you to get in touch with our post-operative nursing team immediately. The next step would be to have an urgent clinical assessment by your surgeon. If you decide to have breast implant removal, we recommend discussing this with your surgeon.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Key points about breast augmentation:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Breast implants are not designed to last for your entire lifetime. It is recommended to have revision breast surgery to&nbsp;remove&nbsp;or&nbsp;replace&nbsp;one, or both breast implants 10 to 15 years after your first procedure.</li>



<li>The appearance of breast implants can change over time due to the influence of significant weight loss, pregnancy or menopause.</li>



<li>Excessively large breast implants could exacerbate breast sagging. A breast lift may be required in combination with breast augmentation to treat saggy breasts.</li>



<li>X-ray mammograms can be more challenging to interpret in the presence of breast implants. However, x-ray technology has significantly improved over the last ten years, making this less of a problem.</li>



<li>We would advise regular checks to monitor for breast implant rupture. Centre for Surgery is one of the few clinics to offer complimentary&nbsp;high-resolution ultrasound scans&nbsp;to monitor the condition of your silicone breast implants. If a potential rupture is detected, we advise having an MRI scan to confirm the diagnosis.</li>



<li>Breastfeeding can, in some cases, be affected by breast augmentation. Although many women can breastfeed normally after surgery, other women may find it more difficult.</li>



<li>Women who have breast augmentation will require regular post-operative reviews to monitor the condition of the breasts and ensure capsular contracture or implant rupture has not occurred.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you think your breasts or implants appear different in some way after the surgery and/or you have symptoms of pain and discomfort, please get in touch with us to arrange a consultation with your surgeon for further evaluation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Am I suitable for breast augmentation?</h4>



<p>We would recommend women be familiar with the potential risks of breast augmentation before considering their suitability for the procedure:</p>



<ul>
<li>Patients should be in good physical and mental health with no chronic medical conditions or active bacterial infection. If you have a significant medical condition, discussing this with your doctor at the consultation is essential to determine if any further investigations will be required to confirm your suitability for the procedure.</li>



<li>Patients with a flat chest or have saggy or tubular breasts are ideal candidates for breast enlargement surgery.</li>



<li>We recommend patients stop smoking and avoid excessive amounts of alcohol for at least six weeks before and after the procedure.</li>



<li>The procedure is designed to significantly improve the appearance of your chest for permanent results. Therefore, we recommend being in optimum mental health to embrace the changes after the procedure.</li>



<li>Breast augmentation is not designed to address body image problems such as body dysmorphic disorder or to make you look like a completely different person. It is vital to have realistic expectations about what the surgery can achieve.</li>



<li>It is essential to follow the post-operative instructions in full. Taking at least one week off work to allow breast augmentation recovery will help ensure your healing is as smooth as possible. You should avoid lifting heavy objects and have someone around you to help with everyday tasks.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What happens at the consultation?</h4>



<p>The breast augmentation consultation is an ideal opportunity to enquire further about the risks of breast implants. Your surgeon will ask the following questions as part of the clinical assessment:</p>



<ul>
<li>Your reasons for wanting the procedure and your treatment expectations</li>



<li>Any medical conditions you may have and potential allergies to medicines</li>



<li>What medicines you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter herbal supplements</li>



<li>Whether you have a personal or family history of breast cancer</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What does the procedure involve?</h4>



<p>Breast augmentation is most commonly carried out under a general anaesthetic to ensure your comfort during and after the procedure. There are three main types of breast augmentation incisions which can be used for breast implant placement, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Incisions under the breast crease (inframammary)</li>



<li>Incisions around the nipple (periareolar)</li>



<li>Incisions under the arm (transaxillary)</li>
</ul>



<p>Once the incision has been made, the surgeon will gently separate the overlying breast tissue from the pectoralis muscle. This leads to creating a breast pocket positioned either on top of the chest muscle or beneath it. The surgeon will then place the implant in the pocket and ensure the implant is correctly centred behind the nipple to prevent implant malposition. The implants are inserted using a breast funnel as part of a ‘no-touch’ technique to minimise implant-related infection. Once the implants are correctly positioned, the incisions will be closed with dissolvable stitches, followed by applying sterile dressings. A post-operative support bra will be applied before the anaesthetist wakes you up. It is normal to have localised swelling and mild post-operative discomfort for up to 2 weeks after the procedure. Any breast augmentation scars will gradually become less noticeable over time, although they will not disappear completely.</p>



<p>If you develop pain, redness or localised warmth around your incisions or you generally feel unwell, we would advise seeking an urgent clinical assessment from your surgeon as these symptoms could be signs of infection.</p>
