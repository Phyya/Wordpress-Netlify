<p>Getting back on your feet after abdominal surgery like a tummy tuck or a hernia repair A &#8220;hernia belt&#8221; is a device used after recovery from abdominal surgeries such a tummy tuck or hernia surgery to aid in the reduction of swelling and pain. This thin elastic band is meant to be wrapped around the belly button. It aids in stabilizing your midsection while it recovers from surgery. The hernia belt is effective in reducing the risk of future hernia development.</p>



<p>Before having surgery, you and your doctor should talk about your post-operative care plan in detail so that you know exactly what to expect. Some patients, for instance, may be instructed to refrain from heavy lifting for a significant period of time following surgery. When doing household chores like laundry or dishwashing, a hernia belt can be a lifesaver, allowing you to stand tall and straight without putting as much strain on your lower back and stomach as you would otherwise (which can cause swelling). Proper preoperative planning, such as getting plenty of sleep before surgery day so that you feel more aware when it comes time to go under anesthesia, is crucial to maximizing your chances of a positive outcome from the treatment.</p>



<p>. Read on to learn more information that you need about tummy tuck with hernia repair cost.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hernia Repair And Tummy Tuck Recovery</h2>



<p>An abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) is a major surgery that removes excess skin and fat from the abdomen. The surgery also tightens muscles. It can be appropriate for women who have had many pregnancies or anyone who has lost a lot of weight.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-abdominoplasty-tummy-tuck-">What is abdominoplasty (tummy tuck)?</h3>



<p>An abdominoplasty is a procedure that flattens your abdomen by removing extra fat and skin and tightening muscles in your abdominal wall. This surgical procedure is also known as a tummy tuck.</p>



<p>Tummy tucks can be thought of as &#8220;mini&#8221; or more involved procedures depending on the amount of skin and fat. It&#8217;s important to educate yourself, thoroughly analyze your own situation, and take your time arriving at a final decision. The procedure shouldn&#8217;t be used as an alternative to weight loss.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="who-are-the-best-candidates-for-an-abdominoplasty-tummy-tuck-">Who are the best candidates for an abdominoplasty (tummy tuck)?</h3>



<p>A tummy tuck is suitable for both men and women who are in good general health overall and are at a stable weight. It&#8217;s best to be a non-smoker.</p>



<p>A tummy tuck shouldn&#8217;t be confused with a liposuction (the cosmetic surgery used to remove fat deposits), although your surgeon may choose to perform liposuction as part of a tummy tuck. Women who have muscles and skin stretched after several pregnancies may find the procedure useful to tighten those muscles and reduce that skin. A tummy tuck is also an alternative for men or women who were obese at one point in their lives and have lost significant weight, but still have excessive fat deposits or loose skin in the abdominal area.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="when-should-you-avoid-an-abdominoplasty-tummy-tuck-">When should you avoid an abdominoplasty (tummy tuck)?</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re a woman who is still planning to have children, you may want to postpone a tummy tuck until you&#8217;re through bearing children. During surgery, your vertical muscles are tightened. Future pregnancies can separate these muscles once again.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re still planning to lose a significant amount of weight, don&#8217;t have a tummy tuck right away. Wait until your weight has stabilized.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that a tummy tuck causes scarring on the abdomen. The length of the scar, which is along the bikini line, depends on the amount of extra skin. With minimal extra skin, the mini abdominoplasty results in a short scar.</p>



<p>Your plastic surgeon will discuss all these options with you when you go for the consultation. You and your surgeon will discuss the results you want, and the surgeon will determine the appropriate procedure during your consultation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="procedure-details">PROCEDURE DETAILS</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-is-an-abdominoplasty-tummy-tuck-done-">How is an abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) done?</h3>



<p>Depending on the results you want, this surgery can take anywhere from one to five hours. Surgery is generally done as an outpatient procedure. If you are traveling out of town to a facility to have the procedure done, you&#8217;ll be asked to stay overnight at a hotel. Liposuction may or may not be recommended at the same time.</p>



<p>You will receive general anesthesia, which will put you to sleep during the operation. It&#8217;s important to have someone with you who can drive you home. If you live alone and you&#8217;re sent home after the procedure, you also will need someone to stay with you at least the first night after the surgery.</p>



<ul>
<li>
<strong>Complete abdominoplasty:</strong>&nbsp;This option is for patients who need the most correction. The incision (cut) is made at the bikini line, at about the same level as your pubic hair. The length of the scar depends on the amount of extra skin. Your surgeon will then manipulate and shape the skin and muscle as needed. You will also have an incision around your navel (belly button) with this procedure, because it&#8217;s necessary to free your navel from surrounding tissue. Drainage tubes may or may not be placed under your skin. These will be removed in a few days as your surgeon sees fit.</li>



<li>
<strong>Partial or mini-abdominoplasty:</strong>&nbsp;Mini-abdominoplasties are done with shorter incisions and are often performed on people who have less excess skin. Your belly button most likely won&#8217;t be moved during this type of procedure. Your skin will be separated between the line of incision and your belly button. This procedure generally takes one to two hours. As with the complete abdominoplasty, you may or may not have drainage tubes after surgery.</li>



<li>
<strong>Circumferential abdominoplasty:</strong>&nbsp;This surgery includes the back area. When there is a lot of excess fat in the back as well as the abdomen, you may have either liposuction of the back or circumferential abdominoplasty. The latter procedure allows for the removal of both skin and fat from the hip and back areas, which improves the shape of your body from all sides.</li>
</ul>



<p>After your partial or complete tummy tuck, your incision site will be stitched and bandaged. Your surgeon may have you wear an elastic bandage or compression garment after surgery. If so, it&#8217;s very important that you follow all of your surgeon&#8217;s instructions on wearing this garment and caring for the bandage. Your surgeon will also tell you about the best way to sit or lie down so you&#8217;ll be in the least amount of pain.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re exceptionally physically active, you&#8217;ll have to severely limit strenuous exercise for four to six weeks. Your doctor will advise you on this as you go through the healing process. Generally, one week off work after the surgery is sufficient for most people to recover properly. Again, your doctor will help you determine this.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-should-i-prepare-for-an-abdominoplasty-tummy-tuck-">How should I prepare for an abdominoplasty (tummy tuck)?</h3>



<p>Smoking can increase the risk of complications and delay healing. If you smoke, you will have to stop for a certain period as determined by your doctor. It is not enough to just cut down on smoking. You must completely stop using all forms of nicotine — gum, patches, and e-cigarettes — for at least one month before surgery and for two weeks after. The longer, the better, in terms of the time between when you stop smoking and when you have surgery.</p>



<p>Make sure you eat well-balanced, complete meals. Don&#8217;t try to diet excessively before the surgery. Proper nutrition is important to proper healing.</p>



<p>As part of your pre-operative consultation, your surgeon may instruct you to stop taking some of your medications that thin your blood and dietary supplements for a certain period before and after the surgery. This includes aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs). You must let your surgeon know if you&#8217;re taking any blood thinners.</p>



<p>Make sure you set up the safest, most comfortable recovery area to meet your needs before you undergo the surgery. Your home recovery area should include:</p>



<ul>
<li>A supply of loose, comfortable clothing that can be put on and taken off very easily.</li>



<li>A telephone within easy reach.</li>



<li>A hand-held shower head and bathroom chair.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-complications-and-side-effects-of-an-abdominoplasty-tummy-tuck-">What are the complications and side effects of an abdominoplasty (tummy tuck)?</h3>



<p>As expected, you will have pain and swelling after surgery. Your doctor will prescribe pain medications as needed.</p>



<p>Soreness may last for several weeks. You may also have numbness, bruising and overall tiredness for that same time period.</p>



<p>As with any surgery, there are risks. You may have an increased risk of complications if you have poor circulation, diabetes, heart, lung, or liver disease, or if you smoke. Complications can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Scarring.</li>



<li>Hematoma (bleeding).</li>



<li>Infection.</li>



<li>Seroma (accumulation of fluid).</li>



<li>Poor wound healing.</li>



<li>Blood clots.</li>



<li>Numbness or other changes in sensation</li>
</ul>



<p>Other complications include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fat necrosis (death of fatty tissue located deep in the skin).</li>



<li>Wound separation.</li>



<li>Asymmetry (unevenness or lopsidedness).</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-outlook-for-someone-who-has-had-an-abdominoplasty-tummy-tuck-">What is the outlook for someone who has had an abdominoplasty (tummy tuck)?</h3>



<p>Generally, most people love the new look after they&#8217;ve undergone this procedure. However, you may not feel like your normal self for months after the surgery. You&#8217;ve gone through a tremendous amount to make this happen. It is a big commitment — emotionally, physically, and financially. It&#8217;s very important that you follow proper diet and exercise to maintain your new look.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="additional-details">ADDITIONAL DETAILS</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="does-insurance-cover-an-abdominoplasty-tummy-tuck-">Does insurance cover an abdominoplasty (tummy tuck)?</h3>



<p>Insurance carriers usually don&#8217;t cover elective cosmetic surgery. But your carrier may cover a certain percentage if you have a hernia that will be corrected through the procedure, or if you&#8217;ve had surgery for weight loss. It&#8217;s extremely important that you begin communicating with your insurance company early on and that you discuss your insurance concerns with your healthcare provider.</p>



<p>In most cases, your provider will write a letter to your insurance carrier, making the case that the surgery is medically necessary (if that applies to you). Insurance may only cover certain portions of the surgery, so make sure you get details. As with any cosmetic surgery, this may affect future insurance coverage for you, and your premiums may increase.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hernia And Tummy Tuck Surgery Recovery Time</h2>



<p>There are many reasons a person may choose to have a tummy tuck procedure, or abdominoplasty. Those who may consider having a tummy tuck include:</p>



<ul>
<li>women who have loose skin or abdominal sagging after pregnancy</li>



<li>people who have excess skin after weight loss</li>



<li>individuals with a protruding abdomen despite losing weight</li>
</ul>



<p>Regardless of the reason, a person needs to follow all postsurgical instructions to avoid infection or other complications.</p>



<p>In this article, we provide tips for recovery from a tummy tuck. We also examine how long recovery takes and what to expect following a tummy tuck procedure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How long does recovery take?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Typically, a person can expect to feel themselves again around&nbsp;8 weeks&nbsp;after surgery.</p>



<p>According to the&nbsp;American Board of Cosmetic Surgery (ABCS), tummy tucks are an outpatient procedure for most individuals, meaning they can go home the same day.</p>



<p>Recovery time from a tummy tuck procedure will vary, depending on factors such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>the type of tummy tuck</li>



<li>the age of the recipient</li>



<li>postsurgical care</li>



<li>general health of the person</li>
</ul>



<p>People should discuss their recovery timeline with their surgeon who can give an estimate that they will base on the individual’s situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Stages of recovery</h2>



<p>A person should discuss recovery time before the procedure. According to the&nbsp;American Society of Plastic Surgeons, a person should ask their surgeon:</p>



<ul>
<li>how to bathe after the procedure</li>



<li>when to remove their bandages</li>



<li>when to return to normal activities</li>



<li>when to return for follow-up care</li>



<li>what drugs they must take after the procedure</li>
</ul>



<p>Asking these questions can help a person prepare and take the right steps for the smoothest recovery possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Recovery timeline</h2>



<p>Immediately following the procedure, a person can expect to go to a recovery room. A healthcare professional will monitor them and check the incision.</p>



<p>During recovery in the hospital, they will receive instructions on:</p>



<ul>
<li>recovery time</li>



<li>how to care for the incision</li>



<li>when to expect to resume normal activity</li>
</ul>



<p>When a person is free to leave the hospital, they will need someone there to take them home. Doctors do not recommend they drive themselves home after surgery.</p>



<p>There may be drainage tubes that need emptying, and the individual will have to record the amount of fluid draining from their wound each day.</p>



<p>At home, a person should make sure they have someone to help them for the first few days, as their mobility will be limited. They may experience tightness around their tummy and only be able to walk hunched over for a week or two.</p>



<p>Initially, they can expect the incision to feel sore. They will likely need to lie in bed at an angle and may also have trouble with:</p>



<ul>
<li>standing</li>



<li>lifting objects</li>



<li>general movement</li>
</ul>



<p>Many people take up to&nbsp;a month&nbsp;off work, particularly if their occupation is physically demanding.</p>



<p>After a tummy tuck, an individual may need help caring for young children for several weeks to months. They should also avoid exercise for the first several weeks until a doctor gives them the all-clear.</p>



<p>However, a person can typically return to activities, such as driving, within&nbsp;1 to 2 weeks&nbsp;and gradually do more everyday tasks as time passes.</p>



<p>Finally, a tummy tuck scar will likely feel sore or tight for several weeks to months following surgery. The visibility of the scar will slowly fade.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Factors affecting recovery time</h3>



<p>Recovery time after a tummy tuck can vary. Some common factors that impact this include:</p>



<ul>
<li>type of tummy tuck</li>



<li>age</li>



<li>postsurgery care</li>



<li>general health</li>
</ul>



<p>The types of tummy tuck include:</p>



<ul>
<li>
<strong>Mini tummy tuck.</strong>&nbsp;This procedure has the shortest recovery time and minimal scarring.</li>



<li>
<strong>Classic or full tummy tuck.</strong>&nbsp;The scar will stretch from hip to hip, and recovery will take longer, but a person should be able to hide the scar under their bathing suit.</li>



<li>
<strong>Extended tummy tuck.</strong>&nbsp;This tummy tuck creates the largest scar. The scar may be visible under bathing suits and takes the longest time to heal.</li>
</ul>



<p>It can be helpful to take steps to avoid constipation after surgery, as some pain medications can slow down the bowels. Straining to have a bowel movement will cause discomfort.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for recovery&nbsp;</h2>



<p>During recovery from a tummy tuck, people need plenty of rest and must follow all of their doctor’s recovery instructions.</p>



<p>They will need to carry out daily maintenance of their incision and drainage tubes. Typically, daily maintenance includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>keeping the incision site clean and dry</li>



<li>changing the bandage daily</li>



<li>taking any prescribed antibiotics</li>



<li>applying topical creams at the incision site</li>
</ul>



<p>A person will likely have a supportive wrap, binder, or compression garment for their abdomen to prevent swelling and reduce discomfort.</p>



<p>Following a tummy tuck, they should avoid smoking and drinking alcohol for at least&nbsp;3 months. Tobacco and alcohol can negatively affect healing.</p>



<p>Also, they should:</p>



<ul>
<li>avoid lifting heavy objects, including small children</li>



<li>temporarily stop exercising until told otherwise</li>



<li>take time off from physically demanding work</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Side effects of surgery&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After surgery, a person may have limited mobility and experience some pain. Typically, the surgeon will prescribe pain relief medication.</p>



<p>The incision will also typically feel tight, causing a pulling sensation on standing or moving.</p>



<p>Finally, a person will find they can no longer do some of their normal activities immediately following the procedure. However, they can return to activities slowly as they start to recover.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When can you resume certain activities?</h2>



<p>How soon a person can return to their normal activities will vary.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;ABCS&nbsp;suggest the following guidelines:</p>



<ul>
<li>up to 2 to 3 weeks for tasks such as cooking, driving, and shopping</li>



<li>around 2 to 4 weeks to return to work</li>
</ul>



<p>However, it is not uncommon to take up to 2 months before a person can return to their normal activities.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Summary</h2>



<p>Full recovery from a tummy tuck — also called an abdominoplasty — can take several months. During recovery, a person should follow all postsurgical instructions and advice, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>avoiding lifting anything heavy</li>



<li>keeping the incision clean</li>



<li>taking time to return to normal activities</li>
</ul>



<p>They should talk to their surgeon before the procedure about what to expect in their individual case.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tummy tuck with hernia repair cost</h2>



<p>The cost of living seems to rise every year. However, wages do not increase unless one either switches occupations or gets lucky when looking for an employer. You can stop wondering things like, &#8220;How much is a stomach tuck in 2020?&#8221; thanks to The Institute of Aesthetic Surgery in Celebration, Florida.<br>Even while you don&#8217;t have to be concerned, that doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t find out more. We know that price plays a big role in your decision to have a procedure done and in selecting a provider. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here to answer your questions concerning the price of a tummy tuck in 2020 and related topics.</p>



<p>Tummy Tuck 2020 Costs: How Much Can You Expect to Pay?<br>&#8216;How much is a tummy tuck?&#8217; is one of the most often asked inquiries we hear about our services. This is a difficult issue to answer because many variables enter into determining the final cost. Unfortunately, at this time we are unable to provide a quote for your belly tuck. However, in the interest of full disclosure, we can go over some of the criteria that go into determining this to give you a rough estimate:</p>



<p>The Scope of the Method<br>In other cases, a stomach tuck entails doing little more than pulling in the skin that hangs around your midsection. However, the procedure&#8217;s reach can expand significantly if necessary. Given its adaptability, the stomach tuck surgery goes by three various names: the full (standard), micro, and extended versions.</p>



<p>An abdominoplasty, or &#8220;small tummy tuck,&#8221; tightens the skin and muscles of the abdominal area. This surgery typically costs between $4000 and $5000. Eight to ten thousand dollars is the average cost of a tummy tuck, whereas twenty thousand dollars is the maximum for a prolonged tummy tuck.</p>



<p>Amount of Body Fat Lost<br>There are a few factors at play when we suggest that the total price will depend on how extensive your surgery is. The number of procedures (such as liposuction, excision of superfluous skin, skin tightening and lifting, muscle tightening, muscle contouring, or muscle mending) is the primary topic of discussion.</p>



<p>The total cost of your operation will increase if more services are performed on you. But it&#8217;s not enough to simply think about how busy everyone is. The volume of work being performed is another factor to think about. An increase in the cost of your surgery can occur, for instance, if we have to remove so much fat that liposuction is necessary.</p>



<p>Extent of the Region<br>The cost of the surgery will be minimal if we only need to remove some excess fat and tighten the skin on your lower abdomen. In contrast, a comprehensive stomach tuck addresses both your lower and upper abdominal regions. Extensive belly tucks, which extend to the sides and back, are the most expensive.</p>



<p>Form of Sedation Prescribed<br>The cost of your surgery will also be affected by other factors, such as the kind of anesthetic you get and how much of it you need. The cost will increase as the size of your daily dose does. The length of the surgery and your weight will determine the dosage that is most suitable for you.</p>



<p>When comparing the costs of different types of anesthesia, general anesthesia is typically more expensive than local anesthetic. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s common practice to combine local anesthetic with a sedative so patients can sleep through their surgery. It&#8217;s possible to spend anywhere from $425 to $1,800 on general anesthesia. The price of a local anesthetic might range from $750 to $4,000 on average.</p>



<p>The Total Amount of Operations<br>Abdominal skin tightening and lifting isn&#8217;t always adequate to obtain the desired result. Liposuction, among other procedures, may be a better option for you in such a circumstance. Liposculpture, or liposuction, is a fat-reduction surgery that uses suction to eliminate stubborn fat deposits in problem areas.</p>



<p>When combined with a belly tuck, liposuction can eliminate even more stubborn fat than the tuck alone can. Liposuction, when performed by itself, typically costs roughly $3,500. However, you can cut costs on both treatments if you opt to have liposuction done at the same time as your stomach tuck. Liposuction prices may also be affected by the complexity of the procedure and the quantity of problem areas to be addressed.</p>



<p>When and Where Liposuction Is Performed<br>Almost any medical facility will do for a liposuction procedure. Common areas for fat reduction include the back, upper and lower abdomen, sides, hips, buttocks, and chest. The remarkable developments in equipment and procedures, however, have made it possible to sculpt smaller areas of the body, such as the thighs, underarms, knees, chin, and neck.</p>



<p>What Kind of Medical Coverage Do You Have?<br>A stomach tuck is typically considered a cosmetic operation. That may be the case in some circumstances. There are situations, however, when a belly tuck is regarded medically necessary. The health insurance company may in that instance pay for the entire price of your operation, including any necessary follow-up care and prescribed medication.</p>



<p>There may be no out-of-pocket costs associated with your surgery. Alternatively, you may only have to pay your deductible and a minor copay for your antibiotics and analgesics if you have your surgery early in the year. Apply for a CareCredit credit card if your health insurance company asks you to pay first and then be reimbursed.</p>



<p>Explain why a tummy tuck qualifies as a surgical procedure.<br>A belly tuck could be deemed medical in numerous ways. It&#8217;s worth noting that full stomach tucks, not small ones, are typically regarded medically necessary. Potential health benefits of a full stomach tuck include easier weight reduction, reduced stress incontinence, healed ventral hernias, and alleviated back pain.</p>



<p>Successful Weight Management<br>If you have undergone a bariatric treatment and have a lot of excess skin, your health insurance company may decide that a stomach tuck is medically required for you. Excess skin on the legs can be a hindrance to exercise, a source of pain, and a barrier to further weight loss or maintenance.</p>



<p>Since bariatric treatments are typically reserved for those with a weight-related ailment, your health insurance company may have an interest in seeing you through to a healthy weight loss. You&#8217;ll get sick again if you regain the weight, and that will significantly reduce your quality of life.</p>



<p>Cure for Urinary Incontinence Caused by Stress<br>A lot of women experience stress incontinence after giving birth vaginally. Leakage of urine occurs during &#8220;stressed&#8221; bladder situations, and is caused by a weak pelvic floor. Coughing, sneezing, running, jumping, and laughing are all activities that can put strain on your bladder.</p>



<p>Your pelvic floor muscles and bladder wall can be reinforced during a full tummy tuck procedure. This means that you won&#8217;t have accidents due to stress incontinence again unless you have another baby and the muscles in your pelvic floor are torn during delivery or you sustain some other kind of pelvic trauma.</p>



<p>Therapies for Back Ache<br>Back pain can be caused by a variety of factors and comes in a variety of forms. Muscular back pain is one subtype, and weak muscles might contribute to this condition. Chronic poor posture or a catastrophic injury, such a car crash, can weaken the muscles in your lower back and the muscles supporting your spine.</p>



<p>When your back hurts, it&#8217;s tough to sit up straight. Poor posture very certainly contributes to the painful cycle that may or may not have begun with weak muscles. If you want to relieve back pain and straighten your posture, a stomach tuck may be your sole option to tighten your loose abdominal muscles.</p>



<p>Surgery to Repair a Hiatal Hernia<br>Another common issue after giving delivery is ventral hernia. One of your intestines has broken through the stomach wall, defining this illness. If you don&#8217;t get this fixed when getting a stomach tuck, you&#8217;ll have to go through another surgery, which will require anesthesia and more costs.</p>



<p>Can You Suggest Any Other Ways That I Can Shape Up To Meet My Goals?<br>Several methods of body sculpting are available at The Institute of Aesthetic Surgery. Come in for a free consultation to find out what mix of cosmetic services will work best for you. This will allow us to see your skin and body in its natural state.</p>



<p>You can provide us examples of the style you&#8217;re going for if you&#8217;d like. We can then have a conversation about your anticipations. Customers who are unhappy with the way their stomach looks are also likely to have concerns about how their body proportions seem. There are others who worry their chest is too big. Some people worry that their hips are too big for their bodies.</p>



<p>Incisionless Breast Reduction<br>You might benefit from both a stomach tuck and a breast reduction if you&#8217;re self-conscious about excess skin hanging around your abdominal area and the size of your breasts. Depending on how much fat you want taken out of your breasts, we can either perform an excision or a liposuction procedure to get rid of the problem.</p>



<p>If you want your breasts to be more in proportion to your waist and hips, we can remove glandular tissue if you are worried about it. Extra skin can be cut off as well. To help men who suffer from gynecomastia, we also provide male breast reduction. The extra fat on the sides can also be removed using liposuction, which is a common procedure for men who are looking to get a tummy tuck or male breast reduction.</p>



<p>Surgery to enhance breast size<br>Once their stomachs are smaller, some women discover that their busts seem better in proportion to the rest of their body. Others are happy with their hip and buttock sizes and wish to combine a stomach tuck with breast augmentation to achieve their ideal proportions.</p>



<p>You may expect to pay anything from $3,800 to $12,000 for a breast augmentation procedure. This range is determined by factors including the anesthetic method, the surgical procedure, the type of implant, and the desired amount of breast enhancement. Just so you know, we can increase the size of only one breast if you&#8217;re happy with the size of the other but not the other.</p>
