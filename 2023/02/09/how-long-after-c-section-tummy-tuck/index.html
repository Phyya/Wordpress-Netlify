<p>The stomach tuck is the most effective approach to remove excess skin and fat from your lower abdomen and waistline, as well as tighten your abdominal muscles. A belly tuck can be performed at any time following a c-section, however it is recommended that you wait at least six weeks after birth. This will give your body time to recover from the c-section and give you time to acclimate to being a new parent.</p>



<p>The recovery time for a belly tuck is determined by the amount of work required. For example, if your doctor needs to remove additional skin or fat from your lower belly, your recovery time may be greater than if he merely needs to tighten up some of your muscles. Because there will be less tissue left over that needs to repair before it can be used again, you will be able to get back into shape faster than someone who had significant amounts of unneeded skin taken from their lower abdomen.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Long After C Section Tummy Tuck</h2>



<p>Pregnancy and childbirth by natural vaginal birth or caesarean C-section can impact your body. One of the main changes that occur during pregnancy is the stretching of your stomach and abdominal muscles –&nbsp;diastasis recti. This can leave you with stretch marks and low hanging, excess skin.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, having a caesarean or C-Section can exaggerate these body changes. It generally tends to leave behind a caesarean pooch or pouch, that hangs low in the abdominal region. Moreover, there is an association between a caesarean section and difficulty in losing weight post-pregnancy.</p>



<p>Many mothers seek cosmetic tummy surgery to help get their pre-baby body back.&nbsp;Dr Craig Rubinstein&nbsp;is a specialist plastic surgeon and mummy makeover expert in Melbourne, Australia.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-want-breast-tummy-surgery-post-pregnancy-download-our-guide-now">Can a Mummy Makeover help</h4>



<p>To help reduce the stress on new mothers after they have already gone through a surgical process of giving birth, there is a special post-baby body rejuvenation or&nbsp;mommy makeover&nbsp;package which includes several cosmetic and plastic surgery procedures.</p>



<p>These surgical procedures can help women get back their pre-pregnancy bodies and feel like themselves again. One of the procedures in the mummy makeover is a&nbsp;tummy tuck or abdominoplasty procedure&nbsp;with muscles repair. It is especially helpful for women who have had a C-Section.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-you-need-a-tummy-tuck-abdominoplasty">Do you need a tummy tuck / abdominoplasty</h4>



<p>A&nbsp;tummy tuck procedure&nbsp;is a cosmetic surgery procedure that focuses on removing excess fat, tissue, and skin from the abdominal region. This removal of saggy skin can help people that have lost a significant amount of weight quickly or those that have had multiple pregnancies resulting in overhanging pooch or skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The procedure enhances the contours of the abdomen while tightening it. This makes it look aesthetically pleasing and more naturally toned. Although removal of just the excess skin makes it sound like it is a small, minor procedure, the tummy tuck is far from it. Tummy tuck surgery is major surgery. It requires those undergoing it to meet certain criteria before they can even be considered for the procedure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anyone thinking about the tummy tuck procedure should be mentally and physically healthy enough to undergo the procedure. This also means that women who have undergone a surgical birthing C -Section should allow their bodies to heal properly prior to undergoing a tummy tuck procedure.</p>



<p>You should also be a non-smoker or be prepared to give up for around 6 weeks before and after surgery. Its also important that you undergo the procedure for yourself, not others or to fit into a specific trend.&nbsp;Read the&nbsp;2022 Top Tummy Tuck Treands.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Can I&nbsp;have a tummy tuck procedure after a C Section?</h3>



<p>A full tummy tuck with&nbsp;muscle repair&nbsp;is a key part of a mummy makeover designed for women after pregnancy and birth. It is designed for women who have given birth recently. So the answer to this question is yes. However, there are a few pointers that you need to keep in mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can have a tummy tuck procedure after a caesarean only if you are having it around 6 to 12 months after the birth. This is so that your body has enough time to heal from one surgery before you undergo the second one. Furthermore, you should ideally only undergo a tummy tuck procedure after a caesarean if you are not planning on getting pregnant again.</p>



<p>Another important factor is that you should be at your ideal post-pregnancy weight. Weight fluctuations after the tummy tuck procedure can hamper the results of the cosmetic procedure. If you are thinking of undergoing a tummy tuck procedure after your caesarean,&nbsp;consult Dr Rubinstein&nbsp;to see if you meet the criteria and are eligible for the procedure.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of Tummy Tuck procedure after a C-section</h2>



<p>The tummy tuck procedure has many benefits, all of which are useful if it is performed after a caesarean. Since the most common issue resulting in women deciding to undergo tummy tuck procedure is the aesthetic of the abdomen due to saggy skin and droopy muscles, it is also the most important benefit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll feel more confident This is because it tightens the abdominal skin and improves the natural contours of the abdomen. Moreover, personal and social relationships improve as well along with women reporting a significant energy boost after undergoing the procedure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A tummy tuck procedure after a caesarean section has many benefits, all of which are related to improving confidence and how comfortable new mums feel in their bodies. It has also been proven to assist posture and reduce incontinence.</p>



<p>You should give your body enough time to rest and recover from pregnancy and the caesarean section before undergoing any sort of surgical procedure.</p>



<p>The ideal waiting time between the two surgical procedures is 6 months to 12 months, depending on your health.</p>



<p>This is to allow your body to regain its pre-pregnancy self and to not be so stretched that the surgeon has a hard time determining the extent to which things need to be tightened.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Can you ask for a tummy tuck during C-section?<strong></strong>
</h3>



<ul>
<li>Yes, you can ask for a tummy tuck during a caesarean section however, that does not mean that it is recommended or that you should definitely do so.</li>



<li>In fact, most surgeons will tell you to refrain from doing so. There are quite a few side effects associated with the C-Tuck procedure.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is tummy tuck recovery worse than C-section?<strong></strong>
</h3>



<ul>
<li>While the pain tolerance differs between individuals, one thing most women who have undergone either mummy makeover or tummy tuck alone and caesarean section agree on is that the recovery from a&nbsp;tummy tuck procedure is far less taxing and painful than the recovery from caesarean.</li>



<li>Moreover, almost all women claim that whatever pain they felt both during the tummy tuck procedure and during the recovery period is far less compared to the C-section procedure and the associated recovery period.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Many Sizes Can You Lose With a Tummy Tuck</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Size Changes You Can Expect</h3>



<p>This tummy tummy tuck cost is highly successful and does result in the removal of roughly 10 pounds of fat as well as inches from your abdominal area. You will be able to visibly see your weight drop as your body becomes slimmer and more streamlined. In most cases, you will also begin to notice that you are able to wear smaller clothing.</p>



<p>How many sizes you go down depends on where you started and how your body changes after the procedure. Most women lose between 2 and 3 pants sizes after a tuck, but there are patients who lose even more. If you had a lot of loose skin before the procedure, for example, you could go down 4 more pants sizes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Other Results</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Flatter Stomach</h4>



<p>In addition to losing pounds and pants sizes, another physical benefit of this procedure is that your abdomen will become flat and harder than it was before. Once those muscles have been tightened and the skin pulled back into place, you will no longer see the sagging you may have had previously. The line of your body will become smoother with fewer bumps or bulges</p>



<p>Most women find that their clothing fits better after the tuck, and they feel more comfortable in tight clothing or an outfit that shows the stomach. You may be comfortable wearing a bikini or a cropped shirt after the procedure even if you haven’t worn those styles in many years.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Better Bladder Control</h4>



<p>Some women experience a lack of bladder control after pregnancy or simply because of aging. When the abdominal muscles are stretched, as they are during pregnancy, they can become weak. The tissue that supports other body parts in the area can become weak as well. This includes the tissues around the pelvic floor and vaginal region.</p>



<p>Tightening the muscles and tissue around this area helps to control a condition called stress urinary incontinence. That’s when your bladder leaks from a small amount of pressure caused by activities like exercise, coughing, sneezing, or even laughing. When the area around your bladder and pelvic floor are frightened, you get more control over the activity there.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Better Posture</h4>



<p>The abdominal muscles are partially responsible for helping you stand up straight and tall. Sometimes weak muscles in the stomach can cause the back to bend forward. You may be regularly walking with a slight hunch to your posture and not even know it. Once those muscles are strong again, you will have the support to hold yourself more upright. This can even make you appear taller.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Higher Self-Esteem</h4>



<p>The results in your appearance after this procedure may lead to a boost in confidence and self-image, especially if you have been feeling self-conscious about your weak abdominal muscles or the excess skin on your stomach. When you look amazing in tight clothing and are standing straighter and taller, you are naturally going to feel better about yourself.</p>



<p>Other people will not know that you’ve had the procedure unless you tell them. They may just think you’ve lost some weight. But they will notice your confidence and the change in the way you carry yourself. They will see that you are happy with yourself which will help lead to happiness in other parts of your life. Some people lose even more weight after the procedure because they are motivated to get healthier.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Pregnancy</h4>



<p>One major reason for this procedure is that women’s bodies change after pregnancy. The stomach muscles must stretch and grow in order to accommodate the child getting larger inside the womb, and that causes a lot of damage to the body. Some women’s bodies bounce quickly after pregnancy, and some are never the same.</p>



<p>Many women find it impossible to return their pre-pregnancy body shape even with extreme dieting and consistent exercise. That’s because some of the effects of pregnancy simply cannot be reversed through lifestyle changes. The skin in that area must be surgically tightened to see a difference.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Loose Skin From Weight Loss</h4>



<p>Sometimes when people lose large amounts of fat, they leave behind loose pockets of skin. When an extreme amount of weight has been lost, there can be a great deal of skin left behind. The skin can be on any part of the body, but most of it tends to occur in the abdominal area.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, when people experience this issue, they are sometimes forced back into the same emotional problems they had before their weight loss. They may feel insecure about the way their bodies look, and they may be afraid to wear certain clothing or show skin. An abdominoplasty can bring people to a place where they can truly celebrate and show off their weight loss efforts.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Back Pain</h4>



<p>Weak abdominal muscles often cause back pain. The back needs the muscles of the abdomen to support the entire upper body. When those muscles are weak, it causes strain to the back. Chronic pain can often be the result.</p>



<p>A tummy tuck kansas cost procedure will pull those muscles tighter and pressure will be relieved from the back. This can drastically reduce or even eliminate the back pain that resulted from a weak abdomen.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Scarring</h4>



<p>People who have scarring from a previous medical procedure, particularly if the scar is vertical. Many women have found that the procedure successfully removed the scar from a Cesarean section birth. The abdominoplasty can also remove some other marks on the stomach like stretch marks, especially if they are below the belly button.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ventral Hernia</h4>



<p>A ventral hernia occurs when tissue is pushed through the abdominal muscles and can usually be detected went the muscles are strained such as during a cough. These hernias can be repaired, but they will often return. A tuck can be used to keep that from reoccurring by tightening the area so that the tissues cannot come through between the muscles.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Who Is a Good Candidate for Abdominoplasty?</h3>



<p>Most healthy people can successfully have the procedure. Men do sometimes have a tummy tuck cost, but patients are usually women.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Before the Procedure</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Consultation</h4>



<p>The first step in the procedure is to have a consultation. We invite you to schedule a time to come into our office and talk with us about whether abdominoplasty is a good option for meeting your goals. We will talk to you about the procedure and answer any questions you might have. We will also make sure that you have realistic expectations and fully understand what the results will be.</p>



<p>We will also use the consultation to ask you some questions about yourself and your background. We will want to know if you exercise and whether or not you smoke. We will also ask about any previous surgeries you have had done, especially if they were in the abdominal area. We will ask you to list all of the medications you are taking and let us know if you have any kind of chronic or recurring illnesses.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Preparation</h4>



<p>Before it is time for your tummy tuck cost procedure, you will have some tasks to complete. We will ask you to refrain from smoking if that is something you do. We may also ask you to stop taking certain types of medication for a period of time before the day of the surgery.</p>



<p>You will also need to prepare for your recovery. This will mean making arrangements for someone to drive you home after the procedure and stay with you during the first part of your recovery. You will need to take time off from work and be sure that all other responsibilities are met so you can focus completely on healing once the procedure is over.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Procedure</h3>



<p>You will come to our comfortable office where we will make sure you are ready for your abdominoplasty. We will give you a general anesthetic to keep you comfortable during the procedure. When you are ready, you will have several incisions made to remove the skin between your belly button and pubic hair in an elliptical shape. The fat underneath the skin will then be removed, revealing the&nbsp;abdominal muscle&nbsp;area.</p>



<p>The tissue over the abdominal muscles will be pulled tight with a series of sutures that will hold it into place. Then the skin around your belly button will be replaced, and your belly button will be put back into its original position with sutures. Any incisions will then be closed with sutures. This can take about 2 to 3 hours depending on how much work needs to be done.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Recovery</h3>



<p>We will help make your recovery as quick and comfortable as possible. We may prescribe antibiotics to guard against infection. We will also provide you with an abdominal binder and show you how to wear it. This garment will support your abdominal area as it heals from the surgery. We will schedule you for several additional office visits to see how you are doing and to answer any questions that come up.</p>



<p>It will take several weeks before you can go back to all of your daily activities, but most people go back to office jobs after about 2 weeks. As your incisions heal, you will begin to see rapid changes in your body. After about 6 to 8 weeks, you will see excellent results.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Long Does a Tummy Tuck Surgery Last?</h3>



<p>Your abdominoplasty is a permanent procedure. Any skin and fat that was removed will not return, and the sutures will stay in place indefinitely. You can, however, grow new fat cells and stretch the skin again. That’s why it is important to put in the work that will maintain your good results.</p>



<p>You will need to commit to a healthy lifestyle and take steps to make sure that you don’t gain weight that will cause the fat to be replaced and the muscles to stretch and weaken again. You will want to keep up an exercise routine designed to keep your muscles strong and working efficiently. Pregnancy will cause damage to the area and result in a loss of benefits, so it advised that you only have the procedure done when you are no longer planning to have children.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Clothes to wear after tummy tuck surgery</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://esseplasticsurgery.com/what-should-you-wear-the-day-after-a-tummy-tuck/"><img decoding="async" src="https://esseplasticsurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/breast-implants-Tummy-Tuck-14.png" alt="tummy tuck recovery"></a></figure>



<p>One of the most popular cosmetic procedures in the world is abdominoplasty. It repairs torn abdominal walls, removes excess fat and skin from the abdomen and lifts the remaining skin for a taut, toned, svelte physique. At eSSe Plastic Surgery in Fort Lauderdale, FL, we receive a lot of questions about abdominoplasty, also known as a tummy tuck. One of the most common is&nbsp;<em>what should I wear the day after</em>. Today, we answer that and give you seven tips on making your abdominoplasty recovery as smooth as possible.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What Should I Wear After Abdominoplasty?</h3>



<p>Immediately after your tummy tuck, your abdomen will be wrapped in bandages. You may also need to wear a prescription-strength compression garment to mitigate swelling. On the way to your procedure, wear loose, baggy clothing.</p>



<p>Rather than your cutest pair of jeans, we recommend a loose pair of drawstring pants. You should also wear a button-up or zip-up shirt that is large enough to wear easily over the bandages and possible&nbsp;compression garment. We strongly recommend against wearing a top that requires you to reach over your head.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">First Week Post-Op</h3>



<p>For the first week post-op, you should&nbsp;continue to wear loose-fitting, soft, comfy clothes. Some women prefer to wear a soft, loose dress rather than a baggy shirt and sweatpants. Whether you prefer pants or a dress, we strongly recommend investing in a soft bathrobe.</p>



<p>Depending on the extent of your procedure, you may need to wear a medical-grade compression garment or regular Spanx garment for up to six weeks or longer. This should be worn at all times except for when you bathe.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Six to Eight Weeks Post-Op</h3>



<p>After your post-tummy tuck recovery, your wardrobe will fit differently. Depending on how much fat and excess skin was removed, you may find that you go down a pants size or two. Unless you already have a sewing machine, you may find it is easier and more affordable to go on a shopping spree than tailor your own clothes down to two sizes.</p>



<p>If you didn’t have much fat and excess skin removed, your clothes might not go down a size. However, your waist will look flatter and leaner without a soft tummy hanging out over your pants. You can still go on a shopping spree, too! Find a bold belt in your favorite color to accentuate your new tight, trim tummy. And don’t forget a little black wrap dress to highlight your new hourglass figure.</p>
