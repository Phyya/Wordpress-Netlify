<p>How long it takes to be able to stand up straight after a tummy tuck depends on the type of surgery you had, how much work was done, and how well your body heals. Most people get tummy tucks to: Abdominoplasty is a surgery that removes fat and skin from around your waist. It is also called a &#8220;mini&#8221; tummy tuck. During this surgery, no muscles or other organs are taken out. It involves removing a small amount of fat from under the skin and tightening the abdominal muscles so they pull in more tightly.</p>



<p>This surgery is similar to an abdominoplasty, but it also fixes torn or broken abdominal muscles. Liposuction and an abdominoplasty: In this kind of tummy tuck, surgeons remove extra fat from the area around your waistline while tightening and lifting your skin. It&#8217;s important to remember that how long it takes to recover from surgery depends on how bad it was, but most people can expect these changes within three months:</p>



<p>Read on to learn more. information on How long after a tummy tuck will i be able to stand up straight, will my pant size change after a tummy tuck. and Who Is a Good Candidate for Abdominoplasty</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img post-id="412" fifu-featured="1" decoding="async" src="https://hourglasstummytuck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/physical-limitations-during-recovery-after-the-tummy-tuck.jpg" alt="How Long After A Tummy Tuck Will I Be Able To Stand Up Straight" title="How Long After A Tummy Tuck Will I Be Able To Stand Up Straight"></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Long After A Tummy Tuck Will I Be Able To Stand Up Straight</h2>



<p>The tummy tuck procedure can bring about positive changes in the body of the patient. It is a major and invasive type of surgery, which is used to remove the excess skin and fat from the abdominal area. Depending on what the patient needs, the surgery may be more or less extensive compared to others who had the same surgery.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, recovery from the tummy tuck surgery still takes time. During the recovery period, there are a few physical limitations. These physical limitations are only temporary, and the patient can go back to their usual activities after they fully recover.</p>



<p>The body will be physically limited after the surgery. Among the physical limitations observed by the patient are the following: not being able to stand or lie down straight, not being able to do strenuous exercises, and not carrying or lifting heavy objects. Although patients are physically limited during the recovery, surgeons still advise patients to walk as an essential exercise after the surgery.</p>



<p>Surgeons also suggest a timeline when activities or exercises should be done. This schedule is also in relation to the physical limitations that a patient may experience after the tummy tuck. It must be followed to make sure that the body heals.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Recovering from a tummy tuck</h3>



<p>Recovering from a tummy tuck takes time, and everybody heals at a different rate. It is important for patients to listen to their body and know how to take care of it properly. Time is a very important factor in the process of healing, which is why the body shouldn’t be rushed to heal or do what it still can’t.</p>



<p>With the tummy tuck, a very large incision is made in the abdominal area. As this is healing, there are some physical limitations that would be felt by the patient. Although there can be limitations, these are not permanent, and the patient can ease back to their usual physical activities as they heal and recover.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stretching is a bad idea</h3>



<p>One of the physical limitations during recovery from a tummy tuck is being able to stand straight. Standing up straight immediately after the surgery will be uncomfortable and bad for the results of the surgery. This position will stretch the abdominal area where the incision is made.</p>



<p>Stretching also adds tension to the incision site. This can negatively affect the scar that is formed. The more stretched it is, the thicker the scar would form. Although there are also other factors that can affect the size and appearance of the scar, stretching the incision site adds to the risk of developing a larger or thicker scar.</p>



<p>Aside from standing up straight, lying down straight should also be avoided especially during the early days of recovery. Patients are required to sleep in a reclined position. This also helps make sure the abdomen isn’t stretched even while sleeping.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Limit exercise</h3>



<p>Exercising is a good thing, but it is not advisable right after the tummy tuck. Patients who have gone through the surgery should limit their exercise to mostly leg work at the beginning of the recovery. Exercises should be gradual so that patients don’t risk bleeding. Limiting the exercise also helps make sure that the tissues in the abdomen adhere to each other at a faster rate.</p>



<p>Some patients who had a tummy tuck also had their muscles tightened at the same time. Due to the muscles being sutured to tighten them, core exercises should also be avoided for up to 4 months. This helps make sure that the muscles are healed first before they are toned or further enhanced.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">No lifting or carrying anything heavy</h3>



<p>Many of those who undergo the tummy tuck are mothers who still have small children. It is very important to remember not to carry or lift the child or any other heavy object during recovery. Lifting or carrying is an action that involves the use of abdominal muscles. This activity could also stretch the skin and tissues in the abdomen.</p>



<p>It is important to find someone to help out with the chores at home during recovery. They can also help the patient move around or get what they need easily. It would be easier to recover when there is someone to help and support you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Walk around after surgery</h3>



<p>Although patients who went through the tummy tuck are physically limited, most surgeons will still advise them to walk around after the surgery. This is the simplest exercise they can do to help their body.</p>



<p>Walking around is advised not only for those who went through a tummy tuck but also for patients who went through other surgeries. Through the movement of walking, the blood circulation in the legs is ensured. This prevents blood clots from forming in the legs and lodging into different areas of the body.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Timeline of possible activities during recovery</h3>



<p>There are some people who may be able to do other activities sooner than others. This is just how their body heals. This is also the reason why patients shouldn’t match what others can and cannot do. Although people heal differently, surgeons suggest a timeline of activities during the recovery from tummy tuck.</p>



<p>Surgeons cannot stress enough about not doing strenuous exercises too early during the recovery. Getting back into regular strenuous exercises prematurely can result in bleeding on the site. This can result in other complications that may also cause opening of the wound.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A day after the surgery</h3>



<p>A day after the surgery, there will be soreness. It is possible you wouldn’t want to move because you are still recovering. Patients would be in a hunchback position at this time and sleeping would also be done in a reclined position.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Two weeks after the surgery</h3>



<p>After a couple of weeks, patients eventually feel better because some of the soreness may already be gone. At this time, only light activity is advised. Walking is a perfect way to start easing into exercise.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Four weeks after the surgery</h3>



<p>Activities involving light weights can be done at this time but only in moderation. If possible, it is still advised not to do any lifting to make sure the incision site is not negatively affected by the force exerted.</p>



<p>For those who had their muscles tightened during the tummy tuck, it is advised to avoid any lifting for up to 3 months. This just ensures that their muscles are fully healed first.</p>



<p>The core plays a very important part in lifting and prematurely doing so will just lengthen the healing process. Letting the body fully heal first before doing any strenuous exercise is one of the best things that patients can do for their body.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Eight weeks after the surgery</h3>



<p>At eight weeks after the surgery, patients can gradually start with exercises that specifically target the abdomen, although it is still best to wait up to 6 months before doing them. Only start with the crunches when it feels right for your body. If it doesn’t, wait a couple of weeks more.</p>



<p>It may seem that you have completely healed from the tummy tuck after eight weeks, but it is still best to do gradual exercises. Shocking the tummy with too many crunches will not produce immediate results and can also negatively affect the healing.</p>



<p>Recovery takes time, and patients should be patient enough for it. The physical limitations push patients to wait until their body is ready. Patients should learn to listen to their bodies and gradually ease into their regular activities.</p>



<p>The tummy tuck is an invasive surgery that will take time before a patient fully heals. During the recovery period, patients should know how to care for themselves especially because they have various physical limitations brought about by the surgery.</p>



<p>The physical limitations will prevent patients from being able to stand or lie down straight, carry or lift heavy weights, and do their regular workout routine. Although there are physical limitations, surgeons will still advise their patients to walk and exercise their legs.</p>



<p>Surgeons also suggest a timeline for the activities that a patient can do during the recovery. This timeline also relates to the physical limitations that a patient encounters during the recovery.</p>



<p>Recovery takes time for all patients, and each patient may heal at a different pace. It is important for those who went through surgery to be patient with their body as it heals. There is no need to rush the body. Eventually, the body will be strong enough, but patients need to take their time and gradually add to the intensity of their activities.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Many Sizes Can You Lose With a Tummy Tuck</h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Size Changes You Can Expect</h4>



<p>This tummy tummy tuck cost is highly successful and does result in the removal of roughly 10 pounds of fat as well as inches from your abdominal area. You will be able to visibly see your weight drop as your body becomes slimmer and more streamlined. In most cases, you will also begin to notice that you are able to wear smaller clothing.</p>



<p>How many sizes you go down depends on where you started and how your body changes after the procedure. Most women lose between 2 and 3 pants sizes after a tuck, but there are patients who lose even more. If you had a lot of loose skin before the procedure, for example, you could go down 4 more pants sizes.</p>



<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Flatter Stomach</h4>



<p>In addition to losing pounds and pants sizes, another physical benefit of this procedure is that your abdomen will become flat and harder than it was before. Once those muscles have been tightened and the skin pulled back into place, you will no longer see the sagging you may have had previously. The line of your body will become smoother with fewer bumps or bulges</p>



<p>Most women find that their clothing fits better after the tuck, and they feel more comfortable in tight clothing or an outfit that shows the stomach. You may be comfortable wearing a bikini or a cropped shirt after the procedure even if you haven’t worn those styles in many years.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Better Bladder Control</h4>



<p>Some women experience a lack of bladder control after pregnancy or simply because of aging. When the abdominal muscles are stretched, as they are during pregnancy, they can become weak. The tissue that supports other body parts in the area can become weak as well. This includes the tissues around the pelvic floor and vaginal region.</p>



<p>Tightening the muscles and tissue around this area helps to control a condition called stress urinary incontinence. That’s when your bladder leaks from a small amount of pressure caused by activities like exercise, coughing, sneezing, or even laughing. When the area around your bladder and pelvic floor are frightened, you get more control over the activity there.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Better Posture</h4>



<p>The abdominal muscles are partially responsible for helping you stand up straight and tall. Sometimes weak muscles in the stomach can cause the back to bend forward. You may be regularly walking with a slight hunch to your posture and not even know it. Once those muscles are strong again, you will have the support to hold yourself more upright. This can even make you appear taller.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Higher Self-Esteem</h4>



<p>The results in your appearance after this procedure may lead to a boost in confidence and self-image, especially if you have been feeling self-conscious about your weak abdominal muscles or the excess skin on your stomach. When you look amazing in tight clothing and are standing straighter and taller, you are naturally going to feel better about yourself.</p>



<p>Other people will not know that you’ve had the procedure unless you tell them. They may just think you’ve lost some weight. But they will notice your confidence and the change in the way you carry yourself. They will see that you are happy with yourself which will help lead to happiness in other parts of your life. Some people lose even more weight after the procedure because they are motivated to get healthier.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why Do People Get Abdominoplasty Surgery?&nbsp;</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Pregnancy</h4>



<p>One major reason for this procedure is that women’s bodies change after pregnancy. The stomach muscles must stretch and grow in order to accommodate the child getting larger inside the womb, and that causes a lot of damage to the body. Some women’s bodies bounce quickly after pregnancy, and some are never the same.</p>



<p>Many women find it impossible to return their pre-pregnancy body shape even with extreme dieting and consistent exercise. That’s because some of the effects of pregnancy simply cannot be reversed through lifestyle changes. The skin in that area must be surgically tightened to see a difference.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Loose Skin From Weight Loss</h4>



<p>Sometimes when people lose large amounts of fat, they leave behind loose pockets of skin. When an extreme amount of weight has been lost, there can be a great deal of skin left behind. The skin can be on any part of the body, but most of it tends to occur in the abdominal area.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, when people experience this issue, they are sometimes forced back into the same emotional problems they had before their weight loss. They may feel insecure about the way their bodies look, and they may be afraid to wear certain clothing or show skin. An abdominoplasty can bring people to a place where they can truly celebrate and show off their weight loss efforts.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Back Pain</h4>



<p>Weak abdominal muscles often cause back pain. The back needs the muscles of the abdomen to support the entire upper body. When those muscles are weak, it causes strain to the back. Chronic pain can often be the result.</p>



<p>A tummy tuck kansas cost procedure will pull those muscles tighter and pressure will be relieved from the back. This can drastically reduce or even eliminate the back pain that resulted from a weak abdomen.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Scarring</h4>



<p>People who have scarring from a previous medical procedure, particularly if the scar is vertical. Many women have found that the procedure successfully removed the scar from a Cesarean section birth. The abdominoplasty can also remove some other marks on the stomach like stretch marks, especially if they are below the belly button.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ventral Hernia</h4>



<p>A ventral hernia occurs when tissue is pushed through the abdominal muscles and can usually be detected went the muscles are strained such as during a cough. These hernias can be repaired, but they will often return. A tuck can be used to keep that from reoccurring by tightening the area so that the tissues cannot come through between the muscles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who Is a Good Candidate for Abdominoplasty</h2>



<p>Most healthy people can successfully have the procedure. Men do sometimes have a tummy tuck cost, but patients are usually women.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;Before the Procedure</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Consultation</h4>



<p>The first step in the procedure is to have a consultation. We invite you to schedule a time to come into our office and talk with us about whether abdominoplasty is a good option for meeting your goals. We will talk to you about the procedure and answer any questions you might have. We will also make sure that you have realistic expectations and fully understand what the results will be.</p>



<p>We will also use the consultation to ask you some questions about yourself and your background. We will want to know if you exercise and whether or not you smoke. We will also ask about any previous surgeries you have had done, especially if they were in the abdominal area. We will ask you to list all of the medications you are taking and let us know if you have any kind of chronic or recurring illnesses.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Preparation</h4>



<p>Before it is time for your tummy tuck cost procedure, you will have some tasks to complete. We will ask you to refrain from smoking if that is something you do. We may also ask you to stop taking certain types of medication for a period of time before the day of the surgery.</p>



<p>You will also need to prepare for your recovery. This will mean making arrangements for someone to drive you home after the procedure and stay with you during the first part of your recovery. You will need to take time off from work and be sure that all other responsibilities are met so you can focus completely on healing once the procedure is over.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Procedure</h3>



<p>You will come to our comfortable office where we will make sure you are ready for your abdominoplasty. We will give you a general anesthetic to keep you comfortable during the procedure. When you are ready, you will have several incisions made to remove the skin between your belly button and pubic hair in an elliptical shape. The fat underneath the skin will then be removed, revealing the&nbsp;abdominal muscle&nbsp;area.</p>



<p>The tissue over the abdominal muscles will be pulled tight with a series of sutures that will hold it into place. Then the skin around your belly button will be replaced, and your belly button will be put back into its original position with sutures. Any incisions will then be closed with sutures. This can take about 2 to 3 hours depending on how much work needs to be done.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Recovery</h3>



<p>We will help make your recovery as quick and comfortable as possible. We may prescribe antibiotics to guard against infection. We will also provide you with an abdominal binder and show you how to wear it. This garment will support your abdominal area as it heals from the surgery. We will schedule you for several additional office visits to see how you are doing and to answer any questions that come up.</p>



<p>It will take several weeks before you can go back to all of your daily activities, but most people go back to office jobs after about 2 weeks. As your incisions heal, you will begin to see rapid changes in your body. After about 6 to 8 weeks, you will see excellent results.</p>
