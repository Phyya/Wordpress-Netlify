<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Laser Hair Removal</h2>



<p>If you’re considering zapping off your body hair, you’re probably wondering about laser hair removal pros and cons. Actually, let’s back up first—if bod-hair removal is your thing (it’s&nbsp;totally okay to grow it out, by the way), there are plenty of temporary options at your disposal. You’ve got the classic, quick (and short-lived) shave, depilatory creams (that typically smell like wet dog mixed with gasoline, if we’re being honest), and slightly more long-term hair removal methods like&nbsp;waxing&nbsp;(no pain-free picnic) and its less ouch-inducing sister&nbsp;sugaring, both of which leave you with smooth skin for a number of weeks.</p>



<p>On the flip side, there’s electrolysis, which produces even longer-lasting results than laser treatments. Electrolysis uses a super-fine needle to kill each individual hair follicle via an electric current. If you’re thinking that sounds painful and time-consuming, you’d be right.</p>



<p>And that brings us to laser hair removal, a popular semi-permanent option that damages hair follicles to minimize hair growth. While its zaps (often described as feeling similar to a rubber band snapping against your skin) aren’t exactly comfortable, the treatment is effective for many people. Here’s&nbsp;how it works: The laser focuses on the melanin (pigment) in hair follicles, burning the hair all the way down to the root, causing damage that discourages future hair growth. Keep in mind that because laser hair removal targets melanin, certain types of lasers may not be compatible with certain skin tones and hair colors (more on that soon).</p>



<p>Not sure if the procedure is right for you? We’re here to answer all of your, um, burning questions about laser hair removal pros and cons—from concerns about your skin tone or the safety of bikini laser hair removal, to how to use at-home laser hair removal devices (which are definitely having a moment right now). Before you sign up for your first session (which will be one of many) or add a DIY device to your cart, let’s break down the pros and cons of laser hair removal treatment.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>First of all, is laser hair removal safe for all skin tones?</strong></h4>



<p>It can be, but no matter your skin tone, it’s crucial to vet your laser hair removal provider (see some specifics on which boxes to tick below) to avoid unwanted side effects,&nbsp;Geeta Yadav, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist based in Toronto, Canada, tells SELF. If you have melanin-rich skin, you’ll have to ask more questions about the type of laser that’s being used during the treatment. (Laser hair removal typically caters to people with dark hair and fair skin, as the stark contrast between the skin pigment and hair is what the laser can more easily recognize and target.) “For example, some providers use IPL (intense pulsed light) technology for hair removal, which targets melanin to destroy the hair follicle after repeated treatments; these devices can cause&nbsp;hyperpigmentation&nbsp;and hypopigmentation in deep skin tones,” Dr. Yadav explains. (Hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation are darker spots and lighter spots on the skin, respectively.)</p>



<p>If you have a darker complexion and want to ensure your treatment will be safe and effective, Dr. Yadav recommends asking your dermatologist about the possibility of using diode, alexandrite, or Nd:YAG lasers (a 2011 study&nbsp;on 150 people published in the journal&nbsp;<em>Lasers in Medical Science</em>&nbsp;found that 86% of participants—whose skin color ranged from light brown to deep brown—had no complications as a result of treatment with ​​Nd:YAG lasers, and the small percentage of people who did have complications mostly experienced some hyperpigmentation that eventually went away).<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Alexandrite lasers might be best for someone with olive-toned skin and dark hair,&nbsp;Rachel Maiman, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist at&nbsp;Marmur Medical&nbsp;in New York City, tells SELF. “That laser still relies on the presence of melanin pigment to destroy the hair follicle, which can result in pigmentary irregularities in patients of darker skin tones,” Dr. Maiman says. The diode and Nd:YAG lasers, however,&nbsp;have longer wavelengths&nbsp;and generally bypass pigment in the skin. For the darkest skin tones, Nd:YAG is considered the best option because it doesn’t target melanin in the skin at all, Dr. Maiman explains.</p>



<p>When it comes to laser-induced skin discoloration, there are risk factors beyond having a naturally deep skin tone. Having sun-kissed skin from a recent vacation or summer of poolside lounging can create a higher risk of skin discoloration since there’s a temporary increase of melanin, Dr. Maiman says. “For lasers that rely on melanin as a recognized target, there’s an increased risk that the laser will detect that pigment, resulting in heat energy delivered to skin instead of the hair,” she explains. In other words, it might be best to schedule your laser treatment before your big trip, and stay out of the direct sun (and&nbsp;wear sunscreen&nbsp;outdoors—but that’s an always rule) as much as possible right before your appointment. If you happen to get a tan, let it completely fade before any laser hair removal, Dr. Maiman advises.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the pros of laser hair removal?</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>While laser treatment doesn’t get rid of hair forever (only&nbsp;electrolysis&nbsp;is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for permanent hair removal), it does drastically reduce hair growth—to the point that many patients won’t see any for months or even years, and the hairs that do crop up are often thinner and lighter in color.</li>



<li>You can get it done anywhere on your body and the machine can cover large areas fast. Legs, back, underarms, bikini line, stomach, face…there’s virtually no limit to the places you can get laser hair removal (if the laser you’re using is safe and effective for your skin tone and hair color, that is). And no, there isn’t a higher risk of side effects with laser hair removal in the bikini area compared to other areas, Dr. Maiman says.</li>



<li>Depending on your hair type and the service area, it may actually not hurt&nbsp;<em>too</em>&nbsp;much. When it comes to pain level, for a lot of people laser hair removal falls somewhere between shaving (painless) and waxing (<em>holy hell</em>&nbsp;that hurts). Technicians typically use a numbing gel to help desensitize the area before and after the laser treatment to minimize discomfort. You might find that bikini and underarm laser hair removal is&nbsp;more painful&nbsp;because those are sensitive areas, Dr. Maiman adds. But in general, the treatment gets progressively less painful with each session, as the hair becomes finer, Dr. Charles says.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What about the cons?</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>It’s a long process. A session of laser hair removal on a small area like the underarms typically takes five minutes or less. However, it takes multiple sessions to see real results (typically between four and six, depending on the size of the area), and you generally have to wait six weeks between treatments.</li>



<li>It’s expensive. If you add up how much you spend on&nbsp;razors&nbsp;or bikini wax sessions in your lifetime, though, it might be worth the laser hair removal cost of about $300-$400 per session, per the&nbsp;American Society of Plastic Surgeons&nbsp;(not covered by insurance, unfortunately).</li>



<li>Since the contrast between the color of the skin and the pigment in the hair follicle is what allows the laser to easily know what to target, laser hair removal works best on fair skin with dark hair, and is not as ideal for darker skin, as discussed above, or lighter hair, regardless of skin tone, Dr. Maiman says. If you have light blonde or white hair, the laser might not be as effective at targeting those hairs,&nbsp;studies&nbsp;show—you might see a reduction in hair growth, but not to the extent that’s typically seen in folks with more contrast between their skin and hair color. Certain lasers, like the Nd:YAG, are better at distinguishing between hair and skin on all skin types, including light hair and dark skin.<sup>2</sup>
</li>



<li>Laser hair removal probably isn’t a good idea if you’re pregnant. “Although lasers have been safely used to treat medical conditions like kidney stones and genital warts in pregnant people, there’s no safety data presently available to support using lasers for cosmetic procedures like hair removal,” Dr. Maiman explains. Many doctors advise against undergoing cosmetic laser treatments while pregnant, in case of fetal risks, she adds. So if you’re pregnant, or possibly going to be in the next couple of months, you may want to postpone your laser hair removal appointment until a later date.</li>



<li>If done by an untrained technician, laser hair removal could leave burns or scars on the skin. Unfortunately, licensing procedures vary from state to state, and sometimes there are no requirements at all. Beware of “laser centers,” since some states don’t have licensing requirements for laser hair removal providers. If you’re set on going to a spa, make sure it’s a medical spa or laser hair removal center run by a doctor who’s board-certified in an aesthetic specialty such as dermatology or plastic surgery, and has specific laser certification (even board-certified doctors who want to provide laser hair removal treatments need further training), Dr. Maiman advises.</li>
</ul>



<p>You should also do your research on what laser might work best with your skin tone, and call the office to make sure the device they’re using is FDA-approved for laser hair removal (look it up on the&nbsp;510(k) database&nbsp;on the FDA’s website to be certain, she adds).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can you do laser hair removal at home?</strong></h2>



<p>The short answer is yes, it’s possible (though people with darker skin and lighter hair should be cautious—more on that below). “At-home devices work similarly to professional treatments, but are smaller and use lower energy levels,” Dr. Maiman says. (The light energy is much less strong than what’s used for in-office procedures, which also makes at-home devices safer to use without much risk of error.) “Because it’s hard to cover a lot of surface area, they’re more time-consuming, but they can help reduce hair growth and can be a great option to maintain improvements between professional treatment,” she says. And since they’re less powerful than the pro devices, they’re also likely to cause you less pain, so that’s a bonus.</p>



<p>The main thing to remember is that these types of at-home laser hair removal devices are, again, engineered for people with a fair to medium complexion and brown or black hair, Dr. Yadav points out. “Like many professional devices, at-home lasers often aren’t ideal for those with deep complexions. That’s also true for people with red, white, grey, or blonde hair–even with in-office treatments, laser hair removal in that setting can be challenging or ineffective,” Dr. Yadav adds. If you fall into those categories, it’s best to schedule a consultation with a dermatologist to determine the right device—whether at-home or in-office—that’s going to be safest for your skin tone and hair color.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that said, if you think you’re a good candidate for DIY treatment and decide to experiment with at-home laser hair removal, you’ll likely be using an IPL device, which uses “a broad-spectrum light-based technology that targets melanin to destroy the hair follicle after repeated treatments,” according to Dr. Maiman, so it’s not&nbsp;<em>technically</em>&nbsp;a laser.&nbsp;Research&nbsp;published in 2019 in the journal&nbsp;<em>Lasers In Surgery and Medicine</em>&nbsp;found that IPL devices are safe and effective at reducing hair growth over time and between laser hair removal sessions for people with more contrast between their skin and hair color.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;(They’re also a decent investment if you want to save the money you’d be spending on professional laser treatment—at-home devices generally range from $100-$500.) And another 2021&nbsp;study&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<em>Archives of Dermatological Research</em>&nbsp;found that at-home devices using IPL had a greater effect on hair removal and, more importantly, were less painful than hot waxing.<sup>4</sup></p>



<p>If you’re in the market for an at-home device, Dr. Maiman recommends&nbsp;Silk’n Infinity, which allows you to customize your hair removal with five different energy levels, and is safe to use all over your body (it’s a small device, though, so it may be easier to use on small areas like your face or upper lip). Have a slightly bigger budget? Consider the&nbsp;Tria Beauty Hair Removal Laser, Dr. Yadav suggests. It’s dermatologist-recommended because it’s pretty darn close to the technology a derm would use for in-office laser hair removal, but still safe enough for a non-professional user. Some other general safety reminders for aspiring at-home laserers: “I advise not using at-home devices near the eyes, over tattoos or pigmented areas, including moles, or in the genital area, though the bikini line can be targeted safely,” Dr. Maiman says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A final word of caution:&nbsp;<em>Less</em>&nbsp;pain doesn’t mean&nbsp;<em>no</em>&nbsp;pain (and anyone who’s ever&nbsp;waxed their own upper lip&nbsp;knows that inflicting pain on yourself can be a special kind of hell), so if your tolerance is low, you might want to stick with gentler at-home beauty treatments, like&nbsp;DIY hair masks.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hair Removal For Indian Skin</h2>



<p>Being smooth and hairless is a universal beauty standard that can easily be achieved through&nbsp;laser hair removal. However, Indians and other people of color have a difficult time finding a laser hair removal device that can work safely and effectively for their darker skin tones.</p>



<p>So which laser hair removal option is best suited for Indian skin?&nbsp;<strong>The most appropriate laser type Indian patients should use is an Nd:YAG laser. As one of the latest lasers available in the market today, the Nd:YAG can work on a wide range of skin types and remove very thick, unwanted hairs.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Makes Laser Hair Removal Risky For People of Color&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In the past, laser hair removal was inaccessible for men and women of color because of how laser removal technology worked. The earliest laser types like ruby and alexandrite lasers were ineffective and harmful when used on patients with darker skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laser hair removal works by targeting the melanin in hair. Melanin is what gives hair its pigment; the darker the hair, the more melanin it contains. When the lasers beam light on the hair follicle, the melanin absorbs the light and transforms it into heat. This heat is responsible for destroying the hair growth center in the follicle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Older laser models could focus on the “bullseye” and remove unwanted hairs more accurately only when there is a contrast between dark skin and light hair. However, this made laser hair removal dangerous for tanned or darker-skinned patients, as their skin contained a high concentration of melanin as well.</p>



<p>Because outdated laser models could not distinguish between pigment in skin and hair, they presented a risk to dark skinned patients. These risks include hyperpigmentation, burns, blisters, scarring, and spots in the skin around the follicle.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As Indian patients have medium to darker colored skin and dark, thick hair, they would need to find a clinic that has invested in the right type of equipment. The laser their provider uses should be able to differentiate between the hair and skin. As darker skin requires cooling in between beams, the laser should come with a cooling function as well. These factors would make the procedure more comfortable for Indian patients.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Which Type of Laser Hair Removal Tool Is Best For Indian Skin?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Patients with darker skin tones have very sensitive skin. As Indian skin tones range from lighter olive to darker shades, it’s especially crucial to identify the specific laser that can work safely and effectively for each patient. There are two types of laser that work for darker skin and dark hair:&nbsp;<strong>diode and Nd:YAG.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The diode laser is good at treating thicker, coarser hair compared to the Nd:YAG. Most diode lasers are less painful because they have an instant cooling function that protects the skin from overheating. However, the Nd:YAG is the safest option for Indian patients because it can bypass the melanin in your skin.</p>



<p>The Nd:YAG works at a higher wavelength than other lasers so it can pass through the epidermis and target the follicle directly. Since it no longer targets the color, the Nd:YAG is great at targeting resistant hairs and treating darker-skinned patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do keep in mind that the Nd:YAG may be more painful than other lasers because it penetrates more deeply.&nbsp; It also hasn’t been around as long as other FDA-approved lasers so you may have trouble finding a provider who uses this type of laser.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Should You Try At-Home Laser Removal Devices?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are a lot of at-home devices and laser kits available in the market but they are not recommended for Indian patients. Most of these products are safer for lighter skin types as they have shorter wavelengths. For Indian skin and hair, these short wavelengths are neither safe nor effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many home laser kits also include screening questionnaires to check if the device can be used on particular hair and skin types &#8212; but most Indian patients will not be able to pass this test. For patients who do meet the criteria, they may find that the results are not satisfactory as the power of a home laser won’t be strong enough to remove thicker hairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although laser hair removal can be costly, letting an experienced, certified provider will save you money and time in the long run.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Ideal Candidate For Laser Hair Removal&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Historically, people with dark hair and fair skin were ideal choices for professional laser hair removal. Advancements in technology have challenged this standard and many people with various skin and hair types can now undergo laser hair removal treatments. Patients who have met the following criteria are most likely suitable candidates for laser hair removal:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>
<strong>Individuals who aren’t pregnant or nursing:&nbsp;</strong>Pregnant and nursing women should postpone their laser hair removal plans for the safety of the child. While no one can say for sure if any harm will happen to the baby, it’s better to exercise caution.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Patients who can withstand pain:&nbsp;</strong>It may be best to reconsider laser hair treatment if you have a low pain tolerance. The process is not entirely pain-free and the laser may feel like a rubber-band snap on the skin. However, most clinics do offer topical numbing cream and pain relievers to keep patients comfortable during the procedure.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Someone who has realistic expectations:&nbsp;</strong>You may be weary of waxing and shaving already but you should know that laser hair removal is not permanent. It’s more like long-term hair reduction because your hairs will grow back slower, thinner, and finer than before.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6 Laser Hair Removal Tips For Safe and Long Lasting Results&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After a laser hair removal session, your skin will be sensitive. Aftercare is imperative to prevent any issues and to maximize results. Here are a few tips to follow after getting laser hair removal:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>
<strong>Stay out of the sun:&nbsp;</strong>When you’re undergoing laser hair treatments, it’s best to stay in the shade and out of tanning beds for at least one month. Your skin needs to be as light as possible when undergoing the procedure to avoid developing any irregular pigmentation in the treatment areas. If you’re going outdoors, apply sunscreen that is SPF30 or higher.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Wait 48 hours before working out:&nbsp;</strong>As much as you don’t want to skip your daily workout, you should give your body some rest after laser hair removal. Sweating will invite bacteria to your body and possibly cause an infection or ingrown hairs. Visiting the sauna, taking a hot shower, and other activities that increase body temperature should be avoided as well.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Keep other skin procedures on hold:&nbsp;</strong>Your skin will be highly sensitive after a laser hair removal session, so skin treatments like chemical peels and other laser procedures should be rescheduled for at least two weeks after your treatment. Giving your skin time to heal will prevent irritation.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Avoid waxing or plucking hairs:&nbsp;</strong>Plucking, waxing, bleaching, tweezing, or scratching the treatment area after treatment are strongly discouraged. Removing the hairs by force may reverse the laser treatment effects and cause hair follicles to regrow. While you can’t pluck or wax for 4-6 weeks, you are allowed to shave 4-5 days after your session.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Skip the makeup and skincare:&nbsp;</strong>Cosmetics, deodorants, and skincare products should be avoided for the first 24-48 hours. Your skin will be red and sensitive so strong products with harsh ingredients may irritate it. If you absolutely have to wear makeup, choose mineral-based products and keep it light.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Apply a cooling compress after treatment:&nbsp;</strong>Swelling and redness are normal after laser hair removal. A cold compress or ice can help bring the swelling down. Moisturize the treatment areas with soothing topical products such as aloe vera gel or arnica cream.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Brazilian Laser Hair Removal</h2>



<p>Imagine a hot summer day with your gal pals, and you&#8217;re all going to the beach. You go to your wardrobe, pull out your favorite itty-bitty bikini, only to find excess hair growing around your lady bits &#8211; yikes! Everyone knows that summer, bikinis, and body hair do not match. Unless, of course, body hair is your thing &#8211; which we are totally here for &#8211; but if you&#8217;re like most people, unwanted pubic hair is the bane of your existence. That&#8217;s where Brazilian laser hair removal steps in. But what exactly is this popular procedure, and how can it be done safely at home?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep reading to find out!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Brazilian Laser Hair Removal?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>When it comes to removing unwanted hair in delicate areas, laser hair removal is the best solution. Shaving around your bikini or buttocks is tricky work and often results in painful side effects like cuts, bumps, and&nbsp;ingrown hairs. Waxing is another popular method but involves ripping and tearing at your hair follicles with hot wax, which can be quite painful, to say the least.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brazilian laser hair removal is an effective method to remove unwanted&nbsp;pubic hair&nbsp;&#8211; without any razors or hot wax. It also solves the complicated issue of reaching around back blindly with razors to catch every last stray hair. Not to get confused with a bikini laser treatment, a Brazilian removes all the hair in your pubic area where a bikini laser treatment only includes the sides of your pubic area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We may call it a &#8220;Brazilian,&#8221; but the custom of removing all the hair from your most intimate areas hails back to&nbsp;400 BC. Even the ancients considered a clean look down there to be aesthetically pleasing. These days, getting rid of unwanted hair has become increasingly popular as clothing has come to cover less and less of the body.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Does Brazilian Laser Hair Removal Work?</strong></h3>



<p>Brazilian hair removal treatment takes care of all your unwanted hair in the bikini region; we&#8217;re talking your whole bikini plus between the cheeks, so your buns won&#8217;t ever have to see a razor again! The Brazilian area is sensitive, but treatment is fast and the lasers used are gentle.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Okay, so how does it work?</em></strong></p>



<p>Laser hair removal treatment works through a focused, coherent beam of laser. That focused laser light pulse is directed to the exact area you want to remove the excess hair from. It&#8217;s set to give a specific wavelength that will seek out the dark melanin pigment in the hair follicle. The melanin will absorb the laser&#8217;s light energy, causing it to heat up and destroy the follicle. Since follicles are responsible for producing new hair, it inhibits future hair growth when they are destroyed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Are The Benefits of Brazilian Laser Hair Removal?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Brazilian laser hair removal is a popular procedure due to its high effectiveness. In fact, when it comes to effectiveness on the beauty of your skin and the reduction of unwanted hair, it outperforms other methods of pubic hair removal by a long-shot! There are many benefits to going bare down there. Here are some of them:</p>



<p><strong>Saves Time.&nbsp;</strong>Brazilian laser hair removal treatments are super handy, quick, and efficient. You get down to business, get your treatment over with, and go out and on with your day like nothing ever happened. Plus, you don&#8217;t have to spend all that time each week trimming the unsightly pubic hair around your lady bits since the results are permanent.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Saves Money.&nbsp;</strong>Additionally, think of just how much of your hard-earned money you spend each and every time you have to go in for monthly waxing appointments. Add that up over the course of your adult life, and you&#8217;re well above how much a Brazilian laser treatment will cost. Sure, it might cost a little more upfront, but you&#8217;ll save much more money with laser in the long run.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Eliminates Ingrown Hairs.&nbsp;</strong>As if the woes of waxing and shaving weren&#8217;t enough, when those pesky ingrown hairs emerge, many people are left to think, &#8220;what&#8217;s the point?&#8221; Well, Brazilian laser treatments can significantly reduce the occurrence of those pesky painful bumps in your pubic region. Plus, it&#8217;s excellent for those who have very sensitive skin and tend to experience irritation after waxing or shaving.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Brazilian Laser Hair Removal At Home&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Brazilian laser hair removal treatment has come a long way over the years and is a safe, highly effective, and relatively painless way to remove undesired pubic hair on a long term or even permanent basis. Back in the day, to achieve hair-free skin in your bikini area, an appointment with a laser specialist was required. Today, at-home options are now available, making it easier than ever to combat frustrating pubic hair once and for all.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, with literally hundreds of home laser hair removal devices available on the market, it can be a little tough to find which is best for your sensitive nether regions. Here&#8217;s what to look for:</p>



<p><strong>Energy Levels.&nbsp;</strong>Most laser hair removal devices offer different energy levels to suit various skin sensitivities. The basic models have three to five energy levels, from one being the weakest to five being the strongest. For your very first use or if you happen to have sensitive skin, start at the first level (level 1) and move your way up as you get more comfortable with a higher energy level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To ensure that the device finds the right energy level for your specific skin type, look for a device with a high number of energy levels like the KENZZI IPL Hair Removal Handset. The Kenzzi has five different power settings to suit your unique skin tone or skin&#8217;s sensitivity while still producing incredible results at any level.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Light Pulses.</strong>&nbsp;The lifespan of the device depends solely on the amount of light pulses it delivers. The higher the number, the higher the lifespan.&nbsp;The KENZZI IPL Hair Removal Handset&nbsp;has over 10+ years of flashes when used as recommended so you&#8217;ll be able to stay hair-free for a very long time!</p>



<p><strong>Warranty.&nbsp;</strong>You can never really be too sure of the product&#8217;s quality that you&#8217;ll be purchasing until you&#8217;ve put in some time using it. For your peace of mind, look for a device like Kenzzi&#8217;s that is backed by a warranty. A manufacturer is much more confident with the quality of its product if it offers a money-back guarantee.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Window Size.&nbsp;</strong>The window is the glass area that will touch your skin during the hair removal treatment. The bigger the window, the bigger the coverage area. Choosing the right window size depends on the particular body area that you want to treat. For Brazilian laser hair removal, a small window measuring around 2-3 cubic centimeters is enough to get the job done.&nbsp;</p>
