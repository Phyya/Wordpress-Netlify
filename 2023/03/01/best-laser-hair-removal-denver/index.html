<p>Laser hair removal works best on people with light skin and dark hair because this combination makes it easy for the laser to target their follicles. If you have darker skin or light or blonde hair, it could be more difficult for your technician to target your follicles without burning your skin too much—so make sure to tell them about any concerns beforehand!</p>



<p>Laser hair removal is a process that uses a laser to destroy hair follicles, preventing them from growing back. This method is an effective way to remove unwanted hair and can be used on any part of the body. It is commonly used on the face, neck, underarms, bikini area, legs and back. The procedure involves using a hand-held device that emits laser light onto the skin where you want to remove hair. The laser passes through the skin and targets the dark pigment in your hair follicles (melanin). The heat from the laser damages your follicles so they can never grow back.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Laser Hair Removal Denver</h2>



<p>For men and women alike, the ongoing management of excessive or unwanted body hair can be a real nuisance in their daily grooming rituals. Temporary solutions for hair growth, such as shaving, waxing, tweezing and depilatories, aren’t just tedious; they are often painful, costly and time-consuming. Excess hair growth can be a source of embarrassment and frustration and can leave you feeling less than your best in your own skin.</p>



<p>Fortunately, advancements in laser technology have provided patients with an effective and long-lasting solution for reducing or eliminating the appearance of unsightly hair growth. With little to no discomfort or downtime, laser hair removal delivers lasting silky smooth skin by preventing hair from regrowing. In a series of laser hair removal treatments, you can achieve the soft, flawless skin you desire and say goodbye to temporary hair removal methods for good.</p>



<p>At&nbsp;VITAHL Medical Aesthetics, we hold ourselves to the highest standards in everything we do. We perform laser hair removal using best-in-class laser systems that consistently provide safe treatments and high-quality results for people of all skin types. Our medical director, Dr. Tahl Humes, and her team have helped thousands of patients look and feel their best, and we are excited to help you enjoy your most vital life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Does Laser Hair Removal Work?</h2>



<p>Our lasers accomplish hair removal by emitting targeted beams of light directly into the hair follicle. This light is attracted to the melanin present in your hair, which is what gives your hair and skin its pigment. When the laser light enters the hair follicle, it heats and damages the hair bulb to prevent future regrowth. The device settings are calibrated to the specifics of each patient based on the color and coarseness of their hair, ensuring both maximum light absorption by the follicles and that there is no damage to the skin surrounding the area. Laser hair removal is virtually painless and provides a safe and effective way to achieve lasting smoothness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are The Phases Of Hair Growth?</h2>



<p>Hair strands grow from hair follicles in your skin. At the base of each follicle is a living bulb, which contains active cells that divide and grow to create hair. Blood vessels bring nourishment to the bulb and deliver hormones that impact hair growth. Between starting to grow and falling out, each strand progresses through four stages. Understanding the natural hair growth cycle helps explain how laser hair removal works.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Anagen Phase</h3>



<p>This is the active phase of hair growth. During the anagen phase, your hair grows as the cells in the bulb at the root of the hair divide rapidly. Each strand is in the anagen phase for two to seven years, making this is the longest-lasting period of the growth cycle. At any time,&nbsp;about 90%&nbsp;of your hairs are in the anagen phase.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Catagen Phase</h3>



<p>In this transitional phase, hair growth slows as follicles shrink. Hair strands disconnect from their blood supply and the cells that produce new hair, becoming dormant. The catagen phase lasts approximately 10 days. Only about 5% of your hairs are in this phase at any given time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Telogen Phase</h3>



<p>The telogen phase is a resting period. During this stage of the cycle, the hair follicle is entirely inactive and no longer growing. The follicle typically remains dormant for around three months before the cycle begins again. An estimated 10-15% of your hairs are in this phase at the same time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Exogen Phase</h3>



<p>Shedding occurs in the final step of the cycle. At the end of the resting period, also known as the exogen phase, the hair gradually detaches from the follicle and falls out. The average person loses 50-100 hair strands each day.</p>



<p>Each hair follicle operates independently and progresses through the growth cycle at different times. If it didn’t work that way, all your hair would fall out at once! This impacts laser hair removal in two key ways.</p>



<p>First, laser hair removal treatments are most effective on hairs that are in the anagen phase. Because it is highly unlikely that every hair treated on a given day will be in the anagen phase, multiple treatments are needed to ensure every hair in the selected area is reached during the optimal stage of its growth cycle.</p>



<p>Second, hair growth cycles vary for different people and on different parts of the body. The optimal number of laser hair removal treatments for you may not be the same as the optimal number of treatments for someone else. Your VITAHL Medical Aesthetics laser specialist will devise a treatment protocol tailored just for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are The Key Benefits Of Laser Hair Removal?</h2>



<p>Denver laser hair removal treatments offer numerous advantages for women and men seeking permanent hair reduction:</p>



<ul>
<li>Noninvasive treatment</li>



<li>Quick and convenient treatment sessions</li>



<li>Customizable treatment settings</li>



<li>Safe for many hair colors and skin types</li>



<li>Can treat most areas of the body and face</li>



<li>Little to no discomfort</li>



<li>No downtime</li>



<li>Low risk of side effects</li>



<li>Long-lasting results</li>



<li>Cost-effective in the long-term</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who Is A Good Candidate For Laser Hair Removal?</h2>



<p>In the past, only individuals with fair skin and dark hair saw fast and lasting results with laser hair removal due to the contrast between the amount of melanin present in their skin and hair. Generally speaking, the more melanin present in the skin or hair, the darker it will be. The prevalence of melanin in darker skin tones potentially put patients at greater risk, while the lack of melanin in blond, red, gray and white hair meant that&nbsp;laser treatments&nbsp;were less effective or not effective at all.</p>



<p>However, today, laser hair removal can be a safe and highly effective treatment for patients with other combinations of skin tones and hair colors, including those with dark skin and dark hair. During your initial consultation in Denver, our laser specialists will carefully assess your concerns and goals to determine if laser hair removal is right for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Areas Can Be Treated?</h2>



<p>Laser hair removal can be used to treat any area of the body where you have unwanted hair growth — even delicate areas such as the face or bikini region. Some of the most common treatment areas for men and women include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Underarms</li>



<li>Arms</li>



<li>Legs</li>



<li>Chest</li>



<li>Stomach</li>



<li>Back</li>



<li>Bikini area</li>



<li>Face and neck</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Lasers Do You Use For Hair Removal?</h2>



<p>VITAHL Medical Aesthetics uses two industry-leading lasers from Cutera® for hair reduction treatments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cutera Xeo®</h3>



<ul>
<li>Nd:YAG laser technology</li>



<li>Customizable treatment options</li>



<li>Appropriate for all skin types</li>



<li>Cooled handpiece increases patient comfort</li>



<li>truPulse technology delivers constant, sustained energy for rapid results</li>



<li>ProWave LX technology delivers effective results for patients with light, fine hair</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cutera Excel® HR</h3>



<ul>
<li>Premium laser hair removal platform</li>



<li>Combines two gold standard laser wavelengths for hair removal</li>



<li>High-power 755 nm Alexandrite laser for finer hair on skin types I-III</li>

<li>Appropriate for all skin types</li>



<li>Proprietary truPulse technology</li>



<li>Superior contact cooling for improved patient comfort</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is The Best Time To Have Laser Hair Removal Treatments?</h2>



<p>Scheduling your laser hair removal treatments outside of the summer months can be the best option. Since it’s advantageous to have as much contrast as possible between your hair and skin, the months when you are least likely to have a tan can give you the safest and most effective treatment. Choosing these months also reduces the likelihood of excessive sun or heat exposure after the treatment, which can negatively affect your results. Late winter and early spring are ideal times for laser hair removal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preparing For Laser Hair Removal</h2>



<p>Laser hair removal will require some preparations in the weeks leading up to your first appointment. Temporary hair removal methods such as waxing, plucking or depilatories must be avoided for at least six weeks prior to your laser hair removal session to ensure the laser can identify the melanin in the hair follicle. You will also need to shave your desired treatment area or areas 24 hours before your appointment. Tanning prior to treatment — including the use of self-tanners — can increase the risk of pigment changes after the laser treatment and should also be avoided.</p>



<p>During your initial consultation, our laser specialists will provide you with all pre-treatment instructions to maximize the safety and effectiveness of your procedure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What To Expect From Your Laser Hair Removal Treatment</h2>



<p>When you arrive for your laser hair procedure at VITAHL Medical Aesthetics, your treatment areas will first be cleaned and prepped, and a topical numbing cream may be applied if you have concerns about your comfort during your appointment. Both you and your laser specialist will wear protective eyewear to filter out any harmful light throughout your treatment.</p>



<p>During the procedure, your laser specialist will hold the skin of your treatment area taut and use a handheld applicator to deliver concentrated light pulses directly into your hair follicles. Patients often liken the sensations experienced during laser hair removal to the feeling of a rubber band being snapped against their skin. However, thanks to the contact-cooling feature on our laser device, these sensations are generally well-tolerated. The melanin in the hair will absorb the thermal light energy which, in turn, vaporizes the hair so that it cannot grow back.</p>



<p>The duration of your treatment will vary depending on the size and number of treatment areas. Smaller areas such as the chin or upper lip may only take a few minutes to treat, whereas larger areas like the legs can take up to an hour.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Many Treatments Will I Need?</h2>



<p>The number of treatment sessions you will require to achieve optimal results will be determined by several factors, including your skin type, hair density,&nbsp;<em>hormones</em>&nbsp;and natural hair growth cycle. We typically recommend our patients undergo<em>&nbsp;six to twelve&nbsp;</em>treatments spaced six to eight weeks apart for best results.</p>



<p>By undergoing a series of treatments, we can ensure<em>&nbsp;that the majority of hairs&nbsp;</em>in your target area is reached during the anagen phase when the treatment is most effective, and you remain stubble-free. With each successive treatment, you will see fewer and fewer hairs return. Finishing the recommended course of treatment in full assures that you achieve the highest degree of&nbsp;(it’s not permanent due to hormones/body) hair reduction possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is There Any Downtime Needed After Laser Hair Removal?</h2>



<p>No downtime is needed after your laser hair removal appointment. While you may experience some redness and swelling in the treated area or areas, most patients will usually resume normal activities or return to work right away. These side effects are generally mild and should resolve within a few days. Be sure to follow your laser specialist’s instructions for post-treatment care, including avoiding sun exposure and tanning, specific hair removal methods and any skincare products that could cause irritation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Results Can I Expect From Laser Hair Removal?</h2>



<p>While laser hair removal treatments are quick and painless, it will take some time for the results of your treatment sessions to become apparent. Over the weeks following your hair removal appointment, your treated hair will gradually shed. Don’t be concerned if you see what looks like regrowth soon after treatment — this is actually the treated hair pushing itself out of the follicle and falling out. Shaving is permissible between appointments.</p>



<p>After completing your recommended course of treatment sessions, you can remain smooth and hair-free for months or even years. If hair regrowth occurs, the hair is often finer, lighter in color and less noticeable. Occasional touch-up treatments may be required to address new hair growth that appears over time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-8dbf4242-2c8c-47ee-b796-2a2c2fc06f63">Can Laser Hair Removal Cause Permanent Scarring</h2>



<p id="block-fdef6b33-f2de-4d3a-8cc2-b0c5192e2fbc">Millions of men and women all over the world have undergone&nbsp;laser hair removal treatments&nbsp;and found it to be a safe medical procedure, if accompanied with some tolerable discomfort. However, there are some patients who experience side effects after their sessions.</p>



<p id="block-5dca797c-0e80-48b6-bc1a-175aba8eae51">So can laser hair removal cause permanent scarring? Generally, scarring is considered to be a rarer side effect of laser hair removal. It is possible but it doesn’t happen often; in some cases, another side effect like burns result in scarring. Skin damage due to laser hair removal usually occurs at the hands of unqualified practitioners.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-3854a493-f0dc-403f-bfd8-f6d3ccedf4ae">Scarring and Laser Hair Removal</h2>



<p id="block-ced3a598-a8f8-4c75-823d-15ccfc66232c">Laser hair removal is one of the most popular procedures for reducing unwanted hair. Common treatment locations include the legs, armpits, upper lip, chin, and bikini line, although you can treat unwanted hair in almost any area except around the eyelids.</p>



<p id="block-32765533-0481-4b4c-8b7b-39ff4c841002">The laser machine used for this treatment works by targeting the pigment in the hair. Once the hair absorbs the laser’s light, it heats up and the follicle is destroyed without damaging surrounding tissues. Most modern machines also have a built-in cooling system so problems are avoided.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-7dbc09f3-c9d1-467e-8ff7-4028bd96a032">Patients who have had laser hair removal done for years don’t experience any long-term problems or health risks. In the hands of qualified practitioners, side effects are usually mild and temporary. More severe side effects like scarring are typically not supposed to happen but may occur due to one of two things:&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-bc7eba81-4e5c-45ed-96e4-613cc69d79c4">Case 1: The practitioner made an error.&nbsp;</h3>



<p id="block-90966cf1-fd54-4118-af87-92df06ff640c">Scarring or wounds may occur if your practitioner is not qualified to perform laser hair removal. One study found that adverse events such as burns or discoloration&nbsp;occurred more often among non-physicians conducting the procedure, as they weren’t given enough training or were not supervised by qualified medical staff.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-2e3363f0-9d46-4668-8114-eb1388a6de04">Ideally, your practitioner should be a medical physician who is board-certified for cosmetic surgery. However,&nbsp;training and certification can also be given to non-physicians as well. Training and practice are crucial for handling a laser machine because there is a steep learning curve. Contrary to a false belief, laser devices are not so simple to use that even advanced users can still run into problems or commit mistakes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-ea3c4ae7-a638-4b65-8140-b32e355d7aad">Case 2: No proper care was given before or after the medical procedure.&nbsp;</h3>



<p id="block-6c326c97-e76a-4c0c-9fdb-179c3cedf68b">Scarring could happen if the treatment area was not correctly cared for before or after the procedure. A patch test can help physicians determine if you’re fit for the procedure or not while a treatment plan can guide them on how they will schedule and perform laser hair removal on your skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-0b838ae9-1a3c-41ec-8ead-45fd9ccd0f2f">Aside from pre-treatment instructions, aftercare is also crucial for lessening risks. Your skin will need to be treated as though it was sunburnt to avoid damages caused by the laser. The treatment area should be protected from light, kept cool and moisturized, and checked for signs of infection as postoperative infections can lead to scarring as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-ea6993b1-033e-4474-80b3-b1517a77da8f">If evidence of scarring is found, patients should return to their physician or practitioner for early treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-6f8832c7-7c0f-473a-abd1-f32e5d4701fe">5 Risks and Side Effects of Laser Hair Treatment&nbsp;</h2>



<p id="block-fb8f8507-c0e3-441d-8e96-85c7f3448a07">Even if you have found a highly-qualified physician who is well-trained in cosmetic surgery, scarring and other side effects can still emerge depending on your skin type, hair color, treatment plan, and adherence to pre- and post-treatment care. Here are some risks and side effects that may happen as a result of laser hair removal:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Skin irritation&nbsp;</strong></td>
<td>The powerful light emitted by a laser machine can cause skin irritation, swelling, or redness as your body reacts to the damages done to the follicles of targeted hairs. However, this discomfort is usually temporary and disappears within several hours. Topical anesthetic cream, cool ice packs, or cold water can minimize reactions.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Depigmentation or hyperpigmentation</strong></td>
<td>Depigmentation refers to the lightening of the affected skin while hyperpigmentation refers to the darkening of the treatment areas. Both pigment-related side effects could either be temporary or permanent; these conditions often affect patients who didn’t avoid sun exposure before or after treatment. Laser hair removal risks are always greater when there is little contrast between hair and skin color because the laser machine might not be able to properly target the pigment in unwanted hairs.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Eye injury&nbsp;</strong></td>
<td>As lasers emit a powerful light, eye injuries can occur if the laser is targeted at the face. Direct exposure of the laser beam into the eye or a reflection of the beam can damage structures in the eyes significantly, causing permanent blindness. Fortunately, eye injuries are a rare side effect as long as patients wear protective, opaque eye equipment.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Infection</strong></td>
<td>All cosmetic hair removal procedures run the risk of infection as the follicles in the skin are damaged. The treatment area should be treated like a wound in these cases. Skin crusting is a similar but rare issue, which can also lead to scarring or scabs.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Burns or blisters</strong></td>
<td>Burns and blisters are uncommon side effects but could still happen if the hair removal was performed incorrectly. High-heat lasers can cause painful first-degree and second-degree burns, although most laser machines have cooling functions that prevent burning the skin.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<p id="block-9e29cf6e-a506-46f6-a417-045bb3510bc7">If you’re interested in getting this cosmetic procedure done, you will have to prepare ahead for it by:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>
<strong>Choosing a board-certified physician:</strong>&nbsp;Ideally, your practitioner is a board-certified physician who specializes in dermatology or cosmetic surgery and has plenty of experience with laser hair removal on your skin type.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Schedule a consultation:</strong>&nbsp;A consultation with your physician can help them create an appropriate treatment plan for you. This is also a good time to review your medical history and discuss risks, expectations, or costs. You can raise your own questions as well.&nbsp;</li>



<li>
<strong>Practice proper skin-care:&nbsp;</strong>Prior to your treatment, you have to stay out of tanning beds and minimize sun exposure. You will also need to avoid other hair removal methods such as waxing and plucking. Shaving is allowed and encouraged, however. You will also need to avoid blood thinner, like alcohol and anti-inflammatory medications.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-542067c1-4b1b-454f-9361-8e35eac82c57">Laser beard shaping</h2>



<p id="block-36a87359-9e65-430a-ae05-16c448f6bd65">Facial hair on men can be time-consuming and inconvenient to maintain, as daily shaving can lead to cuts, razor burn, skin irritation, and ingrown hairs. Whether you’re keeping a simple goatee, a full beard, or just trying to maintain your facial hair,&nbsp;laser beard shaping&nbsp;can drastically help you achieve your desired look.</p>



<p id="block-91b327fa-1410-4afe-b5bf-b449637fde7d">So what exactly is laser beard shaping? Laser beard shaping utilizes lasers on the target areas like the neck and upper cheeks so you can sculpt exactly where you want hair to grow. With laser treatment, men can have a cleaner beard line without harming their skin.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="block-b825d4f7-93e5-44dc-9cbb-298857c96e9f">Laser Beard Shaping For Men</h2>



<p id="block-176e1c06-9ab5-4e38-b42b-1b96af3d868c">Men who are tired of experiencing razor burn or ingrown hairs caused by shaving but want to keep their beards sculpted are increasingly looking at laser treatment to remove unwanted face and body hair.&nbsp;Cosmetic laser hair removal is a practical method for resolving the problem as it can thin out hair by 70% &#8211; 85%. This makes it perfect for trimming your beard as desired and lessening the coarseness of the hair overall.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-030bf127-d58c-4e77-8f0e-41cb21fa7d22">Men can use cosmetic laser treatment on the tops of their cheeks, the stray hairs around their beard or mustache, and the neck where most ingrown hairs appear. Some men also opt to have their eyebrows done as well. Results may vary depending on hair thickness and density, as well as the skin around the treatment area. You can expect results to become evident around two weeks after the first session, although you will need to complete six sessions over 6 &#8211; 8 weeks for maximum effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="block-987bee5c-afc3-47af-9f56-9269f8208baf">The great thing about laser treatments is that your plastic surgeon can really help you achieve the look you want for your beard while keeping the shape of your face in mind. Most results of laser beard and eyebrow shaping are well-suited to the patients and make them look polished.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We all know that conventional methods of hair removal like waxing and shaving can be time consuming and painful, whereas laser treatment is far less painful than waxing and leaves your skin smooth for longer periods of time. This is one of the popular laser hair removal options in Denver. It is a relatively new technology which was introduced in 2010 by the company DEKA LP (Italian company). The company has been producing medical equipment since 1974. This procedure uses a diode laser device that emits pulses of light to destroy hair follicles. The laser light produced by this equipment hits the pigment in your hair follicle and destroys it completely after a few weeks or months. The treatment takes place over a series of sessions depending on how much body area you want to cover. The best result will be seen after 6 sessions of full legs/front + back along with under arms and bikini line</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Wide Range Of Services In One Place</h4>



<p>Laser hair removal is a process that uses light from the laser to remove unwanted hair. The laser targets the pigment in your hair, and this causes damage to the follicle so that your body no longer grows new hair.</p>



<p>The advantages of laser hair removal include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduction of shaving or waxing frequency</li>



<li>An improvement in self-confidence and appearance</li>



<li>Fewer ingrown hairs and razor bumps as compared to shaving or using depilatories</li>
</ul>



<p>Laser Hair Removal Is Not For Everyone. If you have dark skin, coarse or curly hair or are pregnant, consult with your physician before getting any type of laser treatment done on yourself.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Successful Treatment From Experienced Doctors</h4>



<p>Our team is comprised of some of the most experienced dermatologists and laser surgeons in the Denver area. Our doctors have performed hundreds of successful procedures, enabling them to provide you with a safe and comfortable experience.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Quick And Painless Procedure</h4>



<p>Laser hair removal is a safe, effective and efficient treatment. The procedure can be done in less than an hour, and you may only need one session to get rid of unwanted body hair. This compares favorably to electrolysis and waxing which can take hours over multiple sessions.</p>



<p>Laser hair removal uses light energy to destroy the root of each hair follicle so that it stops growing back as much or at all. It works best on dark-colored hairs but is still effective on light-colored ones as well &#8211; even blondes! There&#8217;s no risk of scarring or burning like there is with other methods like electrolysis or shaving, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about long-term side effects like skin discoloration (hyperpigmentation). In addition, laser treatments are not painful at all; however if you have sensitive skin then numbing cream will be applied before treatment starts which helps prevent discomfort during treatment without interfering with results afterward (although it does mean your appointment will take longer!).</p>



<p>Laser hair removal is a very effective way to remove unwanted hair from your body. This procedure has been around for many years now, but it is still one of the most popular choices among people who are looking for ways to get rid of their unwanted hairs quickly and effectively. The best part about laser treatment is that it doesn&#8217;t require any recovery time after each session unlike other methods such as waxing or shaving which can leave you with cuts and bruises on your skin before the next appointment comes up in a few days&#8217; time!</p>
