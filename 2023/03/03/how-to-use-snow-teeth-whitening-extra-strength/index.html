<p>How To Use Snow Teeth Whitening Extra Strength. Teeth yellowing is commonly associated with a diet high in acidic and sugary foods and drinks. These factors contribute to tooth discoloration and staining, suggesting that regular toothpaste brushing may not be enough to restore your teeth to their original whiteness.</p>



<p>Snow Teeth Whitening Extra Strength is the product most recommended by dentists for optimal results when bleaching teeth. Teeth, contrary to popular belief, come in a wide range of shades. As new dentine grows under the enamel, the color of your teeth will change. Teeth lose some of their natural whiteness as a result of this. A great way to keep your teeth looking white, healthy, and brilliant is to whiten them regularly.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How To Use Snow Teeth Whitening Extra Strength</h2>



<p>Your charming grin is one of the few distinguishing features about you. Laughter and a positive attitude are expected in any social or business setting. Many people have to cover their mouths when they laugh or smile because of discoloration or yellowing of their teeth.</p>



<p>While this is a natural occurrence that everyone experiences, especially as we get older and drink caffeinated drinks, it is not something you would want to highlight.</p>



<p>Seeing a dentist for help with teeth whitening is a good solution to the problem. Although getting help from professionals is strongly advised, it isn&#8217;t always convenient.</p>



<p>Getting whiter teeth is a time-consuming, expensive process that requires multiple visits. As a result of the procedure, many patients may feel some degree of pain or discomfort. Additionally, the visible outcome is delayed by several weeks.</p>



<p>Whitening kits designed for use in the comfort of one&#8217;s own home are the answer. In a fraction of the time and cost of a trip to the dentist, you can achieve whiter teeth using the same treatments.</p>



<p>You can whiten your teeth right in the comfort of your own home with a teeth whitening kit like Snow Whitening Extra Strength, which uses peroxide gel to eliminate stains on the enamel and brighten your smile. The manufacturer claims that the product can remove stains from coffee, tobacco, and red wine from teeth.</p>



<p>The Snow Whitening System consists of a gel-filled brush that fits into a tray that is placed over the upper teeth. The tray is worn in the mouth for up to 30 minutes per day, for up to seven days. The gel will work to remove stains and brighten your teeth during this time.</p>



<p>You can use the whitening serum that comes with the system every time you brush your teeth. That way, any remaining stains can be scrubbed away before they have a chance to set in.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Just What Sets This Innovative Teeth Whitening Product Apart From Others On The Market?</h3>



<p>The SNOW Teeth Whitening Kit is currently dominating the teeth-whitening industry. Snow Teeth Whitening products, first and foremost, work on any teeth. SNOW Teeth Whitening products have been proven effective for everyone, even those with unique dental needs like crowns, braces, or extra-sensitive teeth.</p>



<p>The teeth whitening kits from SNOW are convenient and simple to use. As a first step, brush your teeth thoroughly, and then use the provided whitening serum. Avoid getting the whitening serum on your tongue, lips, or gums at all costs. Consequently, the whitening serum application requires extreme caution.</p>



<p>The last step is to put the LED mouthpiece inside your mouth. For the mouthpiece to function, it must be connected to a mobile device.</p>



<p>The mouthpiece can be easily cleaned after use and returned to its packaging for safekeeping after the teeth whitening process is complete. Be sure to give it a thorough cleaning so that it can&#8217;t possibly be harboring any bacteria.</p>



<p>The suggested daily use of nine minutes is extremely practical. You can apply the teeth whitening treatment twice daily if you have stubborn stains or want faster results, but you shouldn&#8217;t leave it on for more than a few minutes each time.</p>

<p>The SNOW Teeth Whitening&nbsp;system is very simple to use. With just a few minutes a day, you can easily, economically, and safely attain the desired whitening effect on your teeth.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Do SNOW Teeth Whitening Products Work?</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Whitening Kit</strong></h4>



<p>Possessing an attractive grin can pave the way to many new opportunities. You should feel comfortable flashing a genuine grin anywhere, whether you&#8217;re at work or socializing. Many, however, recognize their own vanity and prefer to conceal it by covering their face with their hands or a drink.</p>



<p>It can be excruciating to smile because of the constant search for inventive methods of hiding tooth discoloration or staining.</p>



<p>The cutting-edge SNOW Teeth Whitening Products are ideal for this purpose. To achieve the same results would require multiple visits to the dentist, which this method avoids. You can now whiten your teeth without breaking the bank and achieve fantastic results.</p>



<p>Anyone, regardless of age, health, or tooth structure, can use this method. It will come as a pleasant surprise to anyone that the SNOW Teeth Whitening Kits actually do what they say they will do.</p>



<p><em>Here is what you will find in the package:</em></p>



<ul>
<li>Three different whitening serum applicators</li>



<li>One serum applicator for persistent stains</li>



<li>A specially designed guide for teeth shades</li>



<li>An LED mouthpiece</li>



<li>A user-friendly manual&nbsp;</li>



<li>A charger for the LED mouthpiece</li>
</ul>



<p>The kit is very simple to use. First, you apply the serum on your teeth carefully to only go on the teeth, not anywhere else in your mouth. You could start with the basic serum applicator, or, if your teeth are heavily stained or discolored, opt for the extra-strength one.</p>



<p>Following this step, you simply place the LED mouthpiece in your mouth for the specified amount of time. Results are soon to be seen within the first days of applying the product.</p>



<p>After using it, you should thoroughly rinse the special mouthpiece and keep it in its special case.</p>



<p>Once the mouthpiece needs to be re-charged, you can plug it into your smartphone. You may also charge it via a USB or MicroUSB.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SNOW Teeth Whitening Serum</strong></h4>



<p>The&nbsp;SNOW Teeth Whitening&nbsp;kit comes with three standard whitening serum applicators and an extra-strength whitening applicator. You should begin with using the standard one. Its concentration in whitening active ingredients is between six to ten percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The serum has been carefully designed to be free of any potential allergens such as gluten. It is suitable for vegans as it does not contain any traces of ingredients that would be prohibited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No extra chemical substances have been added to the product. All you will find are the usual toothpaste ingredients along with the whitening component. Also, the product has not been tested on animals.</p>



<p>Once you begin the treatment, you can easily keep track of the whitening process with the shade guide. Just after a few days of once-a-day application of the product, you will find that your teeth have become brighter and whiter by at least one or two shades.</p>



<p>If you feel your teeth have serious stains or discoloration, you may want to try the extra whitening serum. The active ingredient concentration in this one is almost double compared to the standard serum.</p>



<p>The application process is very easy. You just need to follow the same steps as with the standard one. You simply apply the serum carefully on your teeth, both front and back. Make sure all of the teeth areas are covered. Then you place the LED mouthpiece over the teeth and enjoy fast and safe whitening effects.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wire-Free System</strong></h4>



<p>There are more reasons as to why you should buy Snow Teeth Whitening System. You can order the cordless kit. This comes in a special casing, including the three serum applicators, the extra-strength one, the user manual, charger cord, shade guide, and LED mouthpiece.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wireless system is a newly launched kit. It allows you to multi-task since now you don’t have to plug it into a device. Also, it is more compact than the standard one and can easily fit in a handbag or briefcase. This means that you can even use it at work.</p>



<p><em>Here are some of the fantastic things about the cord-free kit</em>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Comes with a dual-LED light</li>



<li>Once stored or charged, it will automatically self-sanitize</li>



<li>Great to multi-task or use it anywhere since there is no cord attached</li>



<li>Waterproof</li>
</ul>



<p>The wireless kit is an improvised version of the standard one. The dual LED light will automatically turn on while the mouthpiece is stored away and charging. This is how it self-sanitizes. The self-sanitizing feature is a breakthrough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No foreign objects or any other harmful materials should enter your mouth. This ensures maximum safety while using the product, especially for people with sensitive teeth or those with crowns and braces.</p>



<p>The wireless mouthpiece is also waterproof. You can wear it while taking a shower and minimize the time it takes you to get ready for work.</p>



<p>The mouthpiece’s waterproof characteristic repels any potentially harmful organisms, such as bacteria, sitting on it while it is being stored or charged. This is especially important since this is a device you place in your mouth daily.</p>



<p>The dual LED light, visible in two colors, red and blue, is combined to offer a complete effect on both gums and teeth. The red light works readily on maintaining your gum health, while the blue one whitens your teeth. The result is stunningly white teeth in a healthy mouth.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to use teeth whitening kit with light</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ve chosen the Crest 3DWhitestrips Kit that is best for you, and now it&#8217;s time to use it. Learn how to use your Crest 3DWhitestrips teeth whitening kit with LED Accelerator Light by following the four easy steps below. Soon, you&#8217;ll be on your way to noticeably whiter teeth, 100% guaranteed. How often should you use Whitestrips? Since Crest 3DWhitestrips will whiten teeth for 6 to 12 months, we recommend using Whitestrips twice per year.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
<a></a>Before You Start</h3>



<p>Some things to note: You can brush your teeth gently immediately after using Whitestrips, but we don&#8217;t recommend brushing your teeth immediately before applying them. Doing so may irritate your gums. We also suggest waiting a few days after a professional teeth cleaning to use Crest 3DWhitestrips in case your teeth or gums are sensitive. It&#8217;s a good idea to check with your dentist before you start using Crest 3DWhitestrips, too. Let&#8217;s get started.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Peel</h3>



<p>Getting started is simple. First, gently remove the backing of the teeth whitening strip with your fingers. There are two strips – one designed for the top teeth and one designed for the bottom teeth. Use the longer strip for your top teeth and the shorter strip for your bottom teeth. You&#8217;ll have to do this step with each strip separately, but for now let&#8217;s work with one.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Apply</h3>



<p>The next step is to apply the strip to your teeth (either the top or bottom row, depending on which strip you chose in the first step). To use them, simply remove the backing and apply the grippy side to your teeth. When initially applying the strip, slide the strip so that it is centered on the front teeth as much as possible. Then, fold the strip over to the back side of your teeth to secure it in place. Remember, make sure to use the whitening strip only on the teeth it is designated for – each strip has been specially designed to conform to either the top or bottom teeth. Repeat the peel and apply steps for the second strip. Leave strips on your teeth for the length indicated on your strip sachet (either 30 or 60 minutes).</p>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Boost</h3>



<p>Crest 3DWhitestrips Whitening Kits include The Crest LED Accelerator Light, which puts the same technology that dentists use to professionally whiten teeth right in the palm of your hand. The LED teeth whitening light is safe to use as directed and helps the ingredients in Crest 3DWhitestrips work more effectively by safely penetrating the enamel surface to weaken tough, yellow stains. Unlike other light products that use a broad light spectrum, our specific blue light wavelength was designed to target and neutralize yellow stains. The device was also created to deliver full light intensity across all your teeth for 30% better whitening compared to strips alone.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll use The Crest LED Accelerator Light during the last 5 minutes of the teeth whitening treatment. To start the light treatment, simply press and hold the two buttons on the sides of the device simultaneously to turn on the light, then release. Place the light against the strips on your teeth for 5 minutes. The light will automatically turn off after 5 minutes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reveal</h3>



<p>When your time is up (either 30 or 60 minutes), peel off your strips and dispose of them in the trash. You may have some whitening gel leftover on your teeth, so gently brush that with a toothbrush.</p>



<p>Now, it&#8217;s time to reveal your smile! With Crest 3DWhitestrips, you&#8217;ll get noticeably whiter teeth, 100% guaranteed. So, start smiling and showing off your teeth today.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F35%2F2020%2F01%2Fteeth-whitening-kit-tout.jpg&amp;q=60" alt="teeth whitening kit tout" width="337" height="337" title="Home Teeth whitening"></figure>

<p>Bright, white teeth—everyone wants it, seriously—is the most desired cosmetic dental solution, according to the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry. But even the most diligent brushers have difficulty getting the result they want. Between guzzling coffee or tea in the morning and enjoying a glass of red wine at night, your daily habits can wreak havoc on your teeth. (Related:&nbsp;The Best Electric Toothbrushes, According to Dentists and Dental Hygienists.)</p>



<p>While your dentist can professionally whiten your teeth in-office, those treatments can be incredibly pricey (up to $1,200 bucks a pop). The good news is at-home teeth whitening kits have gotten really good, says Jessica Lee, D.D.S., and president-elect of the&nbsp;American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. Not to mention, teeth whitening kits are affordable, easy to use, effective, and can be conveniently done from the comfort of your couch. The trick is that you must commit to using kits consistently for consecutive days (even up to 14 days) since the results are building on each day for the whitest shade possible, says Lee.</p>



<p>Although a little discomfort is normal when whitening your teeth, you can use fluoride toothpaste or rinse after a treatment to lessen sensitivity, says Lee. Because teeth feel more exposed after bleaching, studies have shown that using fluroide after a whitening treatment helps to minimize sensitivity and strengthen enamel, she adds.</p>



<p>Whether you choose in-office or at-home treatment, the process to whiten teeth is actually the same. A bleaching agent (like hydrogen or carbamide peroxide) is applied to your teeth, and it helps to lift color out of your enamel, also known as the pores of the outermost layer of your teeth, says Pia Lieb, DDS, founder of&nbsp;Cosmetic Dentistry Center NYC. Teeth whitening kits are great for brightening external stains—including those from coffee or wine—however, teeth discoloration caused by age, trauma, or disease would need to be addressed by a dentist, says Lee.

<p>The OG teeth whitening kit, a favorite of Lieb, has recently launched a new version. Like the original, the kit has strips for top and bottom teeth that are applied and left on for 30 minutes. Be sure to position them slightly below the gums to ease sensitivity, cautions Lieb. The main difference between these strips is a burst of mint flavor, which makes them taste good as they whiten.</p>

It&#8217;s easy to use the pen to apply the whitening gel, and then all you have to do is pop in the LED light and let it shine for about 15 minutes a day. Whitening effects of the gel are increased by the blue lights, while sensitivity is diminished by the red lights. Does Light Therapy Actually Help Skin?</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of oil pulling? Coconut oil swishing, an ancient remedy that has been used to remove plaque and bacteria from teeth and gums, consists of massaging the oil into the mouth and swishing it around for about 20 minutes. Burst, however, updated the concept with a strip containing coconut oil. One week of use of a whitening strip containing 6% hydrogen peroxide and coconut oil (which has been praised for its ability to attack bacteria) yields noticeable results. And believe us when we say that 20 minutes of swishing oil is no fun at all compared to 10 minutes of sitting each day. (Self-Care Tip: This Floss Made Brushing My Teeth Fun)</p>
