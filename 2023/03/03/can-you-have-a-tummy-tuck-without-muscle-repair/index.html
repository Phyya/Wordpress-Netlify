<p>Can you have a tummy tuck without muscle repair? What about if you have had repeat cesarean sections? Can anyone of these people successfully undergo a tummy lift? These are very popular questions I get asked of my Atlanta based plastic surgeon. Before I begin, let&#8217;s do a little background behind the abdominoplasty surgery.</p>



<p>Tummy tuck surgery is most commonly performed on women in their 30&#8217;s and 40&#8217;s to tighten loose skin after pregnancy. It can be performed on men, but not as commonly. It is not a weight loss procedure! Muscle repair (abdominoplasty) should be considered with a tummy tuck if you want an improvement in your belly shape and muscular tone (can be combined with liposuction).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img post-id="5277" fifu-featured="1" decoding="async" src="https://cosmeticsurgerytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-308.png" alt="Can You Have A Tummy Tuck Without Muscle Repair" title="Can You Have A Tummy Tuck Without Muscle Repair" class="wp-image-116609" width="544" height="262"></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can You Have A Tummy Tuck Without Muscle Repair</h2>



<p>If the musculature of your abdominal wall has been compromised, such as through diastasis, or by having a weak abdominal wall leading to other medical conditions such as a hernia, then you will need muscle repair.</p>



<p>New mothers may also benefit significantly from a complete abdominal restoration procedure, such as a mommy makeover, which drastically improves both the aesthetics and functional structure of the entire abdominal region.</p>



<p>If, however, you are a patient who has recently lost significant amounts of weight and have excess skin, then it is likely that you will not require muscle repair from your tummy tuck. You will need your surgeon to excise the excess skin, remove some fat tissue with liposuction, and then close the incision and wait for your body to heal over the next two weeks.</p>



<p>As such, muscle repair IS NOT always necessary with a tummy tuck.</p>



<p>In fact, many patients contemplating a tummy tuck will benefit greatly from not having muscle repair, as they will pay less for the procedure and have significantly less downtime as they recover from the surgery.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, an essential step in determining whether or not you require muscle repair from your tummy tuck is consulting a certified, experienced, and credible plastic surgeon.</p>



<p>One of the most common misconceptions I hear from patients is that they must get a&nbsp;tummy tuck&nbsp;to repair abdominal muscle separation. This is not true!</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">WHAT IS DIASTASIS RECTI?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>First of all, what exactly is Diastasis Recti? Also known by the medical term rectus diastasis or diastasis rectus abdominis, it is basically when your “six-pack,” the rectus abdominis muscles, split down the middle. This causes a belly that sticks out, especially at the end of the day and after big meals, and typically does not respond to diet or abdominal exercises.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">WHAT CAUSES DIASTASIS RECTI?</h4>



<p>Abdominal separation is most common after pregnancy. Pregnancy puts pressure on the abdominal wall from the inside, and as a result, the muscles may spread down the middle. The more children you have, the more likely you will experience rectus diastasis since the abdominal muscles will weaken over time. That said, the condition isn’t exclusive to postpartum women. It is also seen in middle-aged, typically overweight men, weightlifters, and women who have gained weight and lost it again. Yo-yo dieters are often prone to it as well. Aside from the aesthetic downside of a stomach bulge, you may experience uncomfortable symptoms such as lower back pain and weakness of your core abdominal muscles. While rectus diastasis is rarely a serious medical issue, it’s uncomfortable to still have a baby belly. Core weakness, poor posture, and back pain do take their toll over time.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">TREATMENT FOR DIASTASIS RECTI</h4>



<p>Now let’s discuss treatment. A rectus diastasis does NOT require a tummy tuck to be repaired. I frequently repair the rectus diastasis through old C-section scars as well as through belly button incisions. I have heard of other plastic surgeons fixing them through the C-section incision (therefore, ensuring the patient doesn’t have additional scarring), but as far as I know, I’m the only one who has done the “umbilicus” incision. Both the C-section and the belly button incision are ideal since the scar stays small and the recovery is much easier than a&nbsp;full abdominoplasty. Not everyone has a C-section scar, of course, which is why the belly button incision can work better for some people.</p>



<p>I’ve been asked, why doesn’t everyone repair a rectus diastasis this way? I think that plastic surgeons were all taught to do these big abdominoplasty incisions, and it’s so easy to see the diastasis through a big incision than through a much smaller hole. As my patients asked me to go smaller and smaller over the years, I realized that it is not just “do-able” to do the surgery through the smaller incisions; it’s actually preferable in some cases. If you don’t need a skin excision, then you’re better off without it. It simply adds scar, risk, and recovery time that you don’t need. And surgically, it’s easier than you would think as the belly button is right in the middle of the abdomen and the distance to the repair is short.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">HOW DO YOU FIX&nbsp; DIASTASIS RECTI WITHOUT A TUMMY TUCK?</h4>



<p>The surgery is done by first making the incision and using the access to “create a plane” between your fat and muscles. That way, the top of the muscles, and the fascia that covers it, can be easily visualized. The plane goes all the way up to the very bottom of the sternum, called the xiphoid process, and all the way down to the pubis bone, at the very bottom of the abdomen. After the whole area can be visualized, the muscles are marked. The “medial edge” of the muscles, which is supposed to be midline, will be split, and the maximum point of the split is usually just under the belly button, right in the middle. Using a special, long-looped suture, the repair is done in one long, strong running repair. Starting at the top, getting wider at the middle, and then tapering back to a point, the full diastasis is brought back to the midline. The central area receives a “double repair” for some patients to ensure a solid surgical repair compensates for the natural higher tension. Then, the patient is seated upright to make sure we “see” all the extra skin and the appearance of the abdomen. As you may have figured out, abdomens always look better lying down, and we need to see it at its worst! With the patient upright, additional tightening is done as necessary, and skin can be undermined laterally to allow the skin to shift to the full abdomen and lie smoothly.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">WHAT ABOUT RECOVERY?</h4>



<p>A drain is then placed that stays in for three to four days, and the skin is then closed with small sutures. The patient wears a compression garment to keep the abdomen tight and supported. After one month, heavy-lifting and exercise can be resumed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">SO WHO IS A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR DIASTASIS RECTI REPAIR?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>These small incisions are great, but they don’t remove any skin – they only fix the muscle. This helps me determine who is a good candidate. A good candidate is someone who has stretched-out muscles but not a lot of stretched-out skin. That means that when you get up in the morning, and your stomach is flat, and you suck in all that extra size, that your skin does not hang or double over. The perfect patient looks great in the morning and then looks more and more “pregnant” or stretched-out throughout the day.</p>



<p>Remember, if you have a lot of loose skin or a very wide diastasis, and then surgically I “cinch” your waist back together, all that skin has to fit a much smaller version of you! If your skin is hanging or loose, you may need some tuck (skin removal) on top of the diastasis repair, requiring a larger abdominal incision. A full abdominoplasty is for excessive skin, and the mini-abdominoplasty is when the extra skin is only present on the lower part of the abdomen, below the belly button.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Tummy Tuck Without Muscle Repair Before And After</h1>



<p>If you are looking to have a tummy tuck, then you should consider whether to have muscle repair surgery with it. There are many benefits to having this surgery done at the same time as your tummy tuck because it will help to improve the appearance of your skin and belly after the procedure is completed. However, if there is not enough loose skin or tissue on your abdomen then you may need additional procedures down the road in order to get the results that you want.</p>



<p>If you have had skin removal surgery in the past, you will need to have it done again. This is because the skin will become loose over time and will not hold your tummy tight enough.</p>



<p>If you are going under general anesthesia, then you should plan on staying overnight at the hospital after your tummy tuck procedure so that they can monitor your vital signs and ensure that there are no complications. If they feel that they can discharge you on the same day as your operation, then they may do so but this would only be if there were no complications during or after surgery.</p>



<p>When you get your tummy tuck, you will be covered with a bandage or other dressing that supports the skin. This dressing is called a compression garment and it helps keep everything in place while your body heals.</p>



<p>The compression garment will likely be applied after your tummy tuck surgery but before going home from the hospital. It&#8217;s important to wear this every day for at least 3 months after your surgery so that you can achieve good results!</p>



<p>This type of compression garment holds the new contours of your abdomen by pulling them tight against themselves to help prevent sagging or bulging areas from forming over time. Also, the elasticity helps prevent fluid buildup under the skin which can lead to swelling; this may cause bruising on top of any areas where fat was removed during surgery (like along hips).</p>



<p>The surgery takes about two hours, and the recovery time is usually between eight weeks and six months.</p>



<p>Tummy tuck surgery takes about two hours, and the recovery time is usually between eight weeks and six months. Tummy tuck surgery can be done in an outpatient setting or in-house at a hospital, depending on what your surgeon recommends. Most women have their tummy tuck surgery performed under general anesthesia. Patients can go home the same day as their procedure if local anesthesia is used for pain management during recovery, but patients who have had general anesthesia will need to stay overnight at a hospital or rehabilitation center after their tummy tuck procedure.</p>



<p>This procedure is often performed on patients who have had previous surgeries in the past because they are less likely to require additional surgery to correct problems with their muscles later on during the healing process. This can save you time and money, as well as help you avoid additional pain and discomfort.</p>



<p>This procedure can be done regardless of whether or not the patient has undergone pregnancy or weight loss surgery. In addition, it&#8217;s common for people who have had multiple pregnancies (such as women who&#8217;ve had five or more children) to undergo this type of surgery because their abdominal muscles have been stretched beyond their limits and will likely not return back to normal over time.</p>



<p>A tummy tuck without muscle repair can be done as an outpatient surgery or in-house at a hospital.</p>



<p>With a tummy tuck without muscle repair, you can expect to be able to leave the hospital in less than 24 hours. You will have some discomfort and swelling but it should not be debilitating. Recovery time depends on your pain tolerance but typically takes 2 to 4 weeks.</p>



<p>The best candidates for this procedure are those with excess skin that is not attached to any muscles or ligaments (such as loose skin around the hips). Tummy tucks with muscle repair take longer for recovery because there is more tissue involved in the procedure than just skin removal alone. It also has more potential complications from infection, bleeding and scarring due to the location of where it was done (underneath all those &#8220;intestines&#8221; we need!).</p>



<p>You can still get a flat stomach without having muscle repair surgery, but it will take longer to recover than a full muscle repair procedure.</p>



<p>The tummy tuck without muscle repair is a skin-only procedure, so it doesn&#8217;t help to tighten and tone muscles as much as a full muscle repair procedure. However, this surgery can still be effective for people who have had previous surgeries in the past—either because of their weight or for other reasons.</p>



<p>For example, if someone underwent liposuction around their abdomen in the past but didn&#8217;t have a proper tummy tuck to remove excess skin, then they may want to consider getting one now without muscle repair. This will ensure that any loose skin will be removed and make them feel more confident about their appearance overall.</p>



<p>It can be hard to know if you want to get a tummy tuck without muscle repair, but it is definitely possible. You should talk with your doctor about whether or not this is the best option for you. The recovery time will be longer than that of a full muscle repair procedure, but you will still be able to achieve your desired results after surgery.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tummy Tuck Without Muscle Repair Cost</h2>



<p>When I was in high school, I weighed more than 300 pounds. My mom used to make me stand in front of the mirror and tell myself that I needed to lose weight and get healthy. She&#8217;d embarrass me by pointing out my rolls of fat, but it worked! Now, when we talk about our bodies, we tell each other how beautiful they are and how much better they will look after we don&#8217;t have any more excess skin hanging around. The trick is finding something that works for you—whether it&#8217;s positive affirmations or just some good old-fashioned meanness—and remembering that you deserve all the best things in life.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">mini tummy tuck cost near me</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">mini tummy tuck before and after scars</h2>



<p>In a tummy tuck operation, your surgeon will remove excess fat and skin from the upper abdomen to create a more defined waistline. This can be performed with or without muscle repair. If you choose not to have this procedure, your scarring may be significant and noticeable. For many patients, however, it is worth considering whether a mini tummy tuck would provide enough improvement while reducing the appearance of scars.</p>



<p>A mini tummy tuck can give patients a slimmer waistline without needing surgery in other areas of their body that would require longer recovery times or more scarring than they would like to deal with at one time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">mini tummy tuck recovery</h2>



<p>&gt; The mini tummy tuck recovery time is around two weeks.</p>



<p>&gt; The process is basically the same as a regular tummy tuck and involves removing extra skin and fat from the midsection, then tightening things up with stitches.</p>



<p>&gt; Aftercare will involve protecting the incision by wearing an elastic bandage for about a week or so. You’ll also want to get plenty of rest in order to let your body heal properly!</p>



<p>&gt; If you have any questions at all about this surgery, don’t hesitate to ask your physician or surgeon before going through with it!</p>

<p>Thanks for the question. A mini tummy tuck is a great option for patients that have lost some weight and want to tighten up their abdomen without having to undergo a full abdominoplasty procedure. The cost of a mini tummy tuck varies depending on the amount of work that needs to be done, but we&#8217;ll discuss the average price range in this article.</p>

<p>Mini Tummy Tuck Recovery Time</p>



<p>Recovery time will vary depending on your specific circumstances (age and health), but generally speaking you can return to most activities within two weeks after surgery (running may take slightly longer).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You can motivate yourself without being mean to yourself.</h2>



<p>There are plenty of ways to motivate yourself. Here are a few:</p>



<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t compare yourself to others. We all have our own journey, and that&#8217;s okay! You&#8217;re on your own path, and it&#8217;s not fair or healthy to compare yours with someone else&#8217;s. When you see someone who looks like they&#8217;ve lost more weight than you have or has more energy than you do, remember that there is no universal &#8220;right&#8221; way to be healthy or happy—everyone is going through their own process at their own pace. Be kind with yourself by not comparing!</li>



<li>Set goals for yourself as well as challenges (but don&#8217;t self-sabotage). Challenges can help keep us motivated because they give us something specific we want to accomplish—a deadline, maybe? Or maybe an event? For example: I want lose 20 pounds by next month; I need three new clients before the end of June; This year I am going backpacking through Europe (and I&#8217;m going solo!).</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">how to do lymphatic massage after tummy tuck at home</h1>



<p>After a tummy tuck, it’s important to do everything you can in order to ensure the best possible results. One of the best ways is through lymphatic massage. In this article, we’ll tell you how it works and show you how to do lymphatic massage after tummy tuck at home.</p>



<p>In order for a tummy tuck to be successful, it’s important your body has the capability to heal itself. One of the best ways to ensure this happens is through lymphatic massage — but how do you do that at home?</p>



<p>Lymphatic massage is a type of massage that encourages the movement of fluids through your body. It helps improve your immune system and helps your body recover from injuries or surgery. It is especially beneficial after liposuction, or on areas with lymphedema (a condition where swelling occurs due to fluid buildup).</p>



<p>Lymphatic massage is a type of massage used in natural healing traditions that encourages the movement of fluids through your body. This type of massage helps improve your immune system and helps your body recover from injuries or surgery. Lymphatic drainage therapy is especially beneficial after liposuction, or on areas with lymphedema.</p>



<p>Lymphatic drainage massage has been used for thousands of years to treat swelling, fluid retention and cellulite. The lymphatic system works to move waste products away from where they are produced in order to keep all bodily tissues clear, healthy and functioning properly.</p>



<p>The lymphatic system consists of vessels that transport lymph (a clear fluid consisting mainly of white blood cells). There are two main types: arteries and veins. Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart; veins return de-oxygenated blood back toward the heart&#8217;s right atrium chamber via capillaries within tissues throughout the body&#8217;s tissues where it eventually reenters venous system through small veins near ankles or feet before returning back into larger vein which carries it back up towards lungs where carbon dioxide is removed again before being replaced with more fresh oxygen rich air as its finally expelled out mouth during exhalation process via respiration process when exhaling breath after inhaling new breath into lungs during inhalation phase prior to beginning next cycle again until death occurs!</p>



<p>A lymphatic drainage massage after tummy tuck may help speed up the healing process in that area of your body and encourage tissue regeneration. Plus, it can also help lessen the risk for infection.</p>



<p>You should start massaging your stomach as soon as you are able to move around comfortably. You can even do this while lying down on your bed or sofa at home with a pillow under your head so that you can see what you are doing.</p>



<p>To do a lymphatic massage after tummy tuck:</p>



<ul>
<li>Start by using gentle circular motions with each finger pad on one hand, starting from above where the incision line is located and moving downward towards the navel area. Repeat this process several times until all areas have been massaged (about 20 seconds).</li>



<li>Next switch to using two fingers instead of just one—you&#8217;ll want one finger at each end of an imaginary line extending from under one armpit across to its counterpart under the other arm pit—and then use these two fingers against their respective sides of this same imaginary line for about 30 seconds total time; repeat this two-finger technique twice more for a total time of 90 seconds total per session/day if possible (total sessions would therefore be three).</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s important to note that hand-held massagers can sometimes cause more harm than good if you get too carried away with them (and you could end up with bruises). So instead, consider essential oils as an alternative way to get your lymph nodes flowing after surgery.</p>



<p>Essential oils are natural compounds extracted from plants, flowers and other herbs. They don’t create any side effects like some medications do, which makes them great for those who want to avoid drugs but still want relief from pain and swelling following surgery.</p>



<p>Essential oils can be used in conjunction with lotions or creams for added effect. If this is something you’re interested in pursuing further, check out our article on Essential Oil Massages After Tummy Tuck Surgery!</p>



<p>To help the lymphatic system drain, you can apply a few essential oils to the area. These include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lavender oil</li>



<li>Peppermint oil</li>



<li>Clary sage oil</li>



<li>Bergamot oil</li>
</ul>
