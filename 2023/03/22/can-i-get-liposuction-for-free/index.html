<p>Have you ever wondered if you can get liposuction for free? Well, the short answer is no. This is because liposuction is considered a cosmetic procedure and as such it has to be paid for by the patient. But, there are some ways that you can reduce the cost of your procedure.</p>



<p>You could try negotiating with your surgeon who may be willing to offer you a discount on their services if they know that your case will take longer than expected or if they think that you are going to be difficult to deal with in general, for example if you are not going to be able to come up with the money for them on time or if they&#8217;ve had problems with other patients like yourself before then this might work out well for everyone involved but remember that if it does then it will also mean that everyone else will get charged more money so keep this in mind before making any decisions like this because there&#8217;s nothing worse than having wasted money when all said and done.</p>



<p>Read on to learn more about Can I Get Liposuction For Free, How Many Sizes Do You Lose With A Tummy Tuck</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can I Get Liposuction For Free</h2>



<p>Want bigger breasts but don’t want implants? How about a tighter tummy without liposuction?</p>



<p>New cosmetic treatments—many of them non-surgical—mean more options than ever for men and women who aren’t completely happy with their bodies.</p>



<p>Here are the latest, most effective, easiest, laziest—and sometimes craziest—procedures to transform trouble spots.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Flatter Stomach</h3>



<p>The midsection is prone to three frustrating but common conditions: excess fat, loose skin, and stretch marks. Some ways to address them, from most to least invasive:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Most Dramatic: Tucking It In</h4>



<p>Only one procedure—a&nbsp;<strong>tummy tuck,</strong>&nbsp;or abdominoplasty—can fix all three problems common to the belly. “It’s the only proven way to address fat, saggy skin and gaps between the abdominal muscles, which contribute to that bulging look,” says Rondi Walker, a plastic surgeon in DC. “But if you’re close to your ideal weight, have good skin tone, and just have some excess abdominal fat, you can get good results with&nbsp;<strong>liposuction,&nbsp;</strong>which only addresses the fat.”</p>



<p>Abdominoplasty costs $4,000 to $15,000, depending on the extent of the procedure, while lipo runs $5,000 to $10,500. With lipo, expect up to four weeks of recovery time versus up to eight for a tummy tuck (which also comes with a long horizontal scar along the bikini line).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Non-Surgical Approach</h4>



<p>For those who have less fat to remove—or are willing to trade dramatic results for an easier, less expensive option to lipo—a new procedure called&nbsp;<strong>Vanquish</strong>&nbsp;goes one step beyond non-invasive: It never touches your body. An applicator that hovers over the skin delivers radio-frequency (RF) energy that heats fat cells to 120 degrees, killing them.</p>



<p>The procedure is painless and can treat a larger area than most other RF devices. If you want to target the entire abdomen instead of just love handles, this procedure can do it.</p>



<p>“A patient can expect up to 60 percent of fat cells destroyed after four treatments,” says Nia Banks, a plastic surgeon in Lanham. “However, people who practice light to moderate exercise and maintain a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water, have the best outcome.”</p>



<p>Four to six treatments are recommended, one to two weeks apart, to destroy fat cells permanently.&nbsp;<em>Cost: $500 to $750 a session.</em></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Quick Fix</h4>



<p>Loose abdominal skin—whether from aging, pregnancy, or weight loss—can prevent even the most toned abs from looking firm.</p>



<p>“Skin becomes less stretchy due to the gradual loss of collagen and elastin—like a tablecloth that is too big for the table,” says Chevy Chase dermatologist Tina West. “In the past, the only option was a tummy tuck, but you’d trade loose skin for a scar from hip to hip.”</p>



<p>In appropriate cases, West now recommends&nbsp;<strong>Ultherapy,</strong>&nbsp;an ultrasound procedure that stimulates collagen and elastin growth for two to three months following treatment, resulting in firmer skin. It’s the only non-invasive procedure approved by the Food and Drug Administration to lift skin that’s above the eyebrows, on the neck, under the chin, and on the décolletage, although it’s commonly used on other areas as well.</p>



<p>There’s no downtime, and treatment typically takes 30 to 90 minutes—just one session is needed for most patients. Those with too much excess skin might not be good candidates.&nbsp;<em>Cost: $1,200 and up.</em></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Fading Stretch Marks</h4>



<p>A stretch mark is a scar in the skin, so it can be hard to treat. Dr. Banks says that fractional-laser treatments such as&nbsp;<strong>Fraxel</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Fractional CO2</strong>&nbsp;can stimulate collagen and elastic-fiber growth to fill them in and minimize their appearance. If the marks are pink or purplish, a laser can also diminish the color, making them less noticeable. Multiple treatments are usually required.&nbsp;<em>Cost: $1,500 and up.</em></p>



<p>Prefer a less invasive approach? Some doctors recommend prescription&nbsp;<strong>tretinoin,</strong>&nbsp;or Retin-A, to fade stretch marks. It’s most effective when applied to fresh marks that are still pink or red.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Perkier Breasts</h3>



<p>Washingtonians like big titles and big houses—but not big breasts, apparently. Women here who have work done tend to skew conservative (read: smaller) when it comes to implant size. “Women want to address sagging, the silhouette, the overall look—they’re looking for rejuvenation more than just augmentation,” says Navin Singh, a plastic surgeon with offices in McLean and Chevy Chase. “It’s about shaping as opposed to stuffing.” Here are the latest options:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The New Shape of Breast Implants</h4>



<p>The big news in implants is that fake is going natural. “A more naturally sloped look is popular right now, especially with the new, shaped implants,” says Banks.</p>



<p>The idea is to appear bigger and perkier without announcing that you’ve had work done. Instead of the rounder, fuller look (and added cleavage) of traditional implants, “teardrop” versions are tapered to mimic the silhouette of an actual breast.&nbsp;<strong>Mentor MemoryShape</strong>&nbsp;silicone implant has been dubbed the “gummy bear” because it’s filled with thicker gel and maintains its shape longer than traditional implants.&nbsp;<strong>Allergan’s Natrelle 410&nbsp;</strong>implants are designed to be softer so they feel more, well, real. The surgery is very similar to what’s done for rounder counterparts, but the price is a bit higher: $6,000 and up.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bigger Breasts Without Implants</h4>



<p>If you want to go up only about one cup size and prefer not to have implants,&nbsp;<strong>fat grafting</strong>&nbsp;is an option. Assuming you have enough extra fat in another part of the body, a surgeon can remove it from, say, the stomach, by liposuction, and use it to plump up your breasts.</p>



<p>Unlike implants, fat is a natural filler, so you’re not introducing a foreign substance into the body. There’s minimal scarring, as opposed to the larger scars of traditional augmentation surgery. It also eliminates the need to replace an implant later.</p>



<p>“Typically, 30 to 40 percent of the fat will be safely absorbed and flushed by the body, but the rest will survive permanently,” says Dr. Singh. “If a woman likes how her breasts looked when she was pregnant or breastfeeding, this gives the same effect of filling out the bra in a more natural-looking way—and of course, the feel is soft since every woman’s breasts are typically 70 to 80 percent fat.”&nbsp;<em>Cost: $6,000 to $7,000.</em></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">One-Night Boobs</h4>



<p>If buying a sexy new dress and a cleavage-hoisting bra isn’t enough to get you through your high-school reunion or an ex’s wedding, you can essentially rent implants for the night.&nbsp;<strong>InstaBreast</strong>&nbsp;is a procedure that involves injecting the breasts with a saline solution that plumps them up the same way an implant would. Originally developed so women could figure out what size they wanted before making a surgical commitment, it’s now being chosen by some women who want a Cinderella moment—and are willing to pay $2,500.</p>



<p>Alas, much like Cinderella, you’ll have to watch the clock as your boobs turn into the opposite of pumpkins. “Saline absorbs very quickly, so you’re not looking at 24 hours—within an hour, your breasts will start to deflate,” says Singh, who considers the procedure a gimmick. “They’re a great choice for a supermodel who needs to get through a photo shoot, but that’s about it.”</p>



<p>Side effects may include bruising at the injection site and lots of trips to the ladies’ room as the saline leaves the body through urine. Stretch marks may also appear if the skin is significantly stretched.</p>



<p>Possible good news: The inventor of InstaBreast is said to be developing an injectable solution that will last two to three weeks.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Exercise Option for “Lifting” Breasts</h4>



<p>You can also perk up your breasts by doing specific weightlifting exercises that help improve posture.</p>



<p><strong>Cheryl Davis,</strong>&nbsp;a certified personal trainer in Alexandria, recommends push-ups, pull-ups, seated cable rows, and exercises that target the lower back to give a lifted appearance. She doesn’t suggest doing chest presses on a flat bench. “If you’re doing flat-bench or decline chest presses”—in which the bench is tilted so your head is below your waist—“it’s likely to flatten the part of the breast where you’d want fullness,” says Davis.</p>



<p>For working the chest, she says, stick to incline bench presses. Position the top part of a weight bench at a 30-degree incline. Lie back and put your elbows at a 90-degree angle, in line with your shoulders. Press up-ward with the dumbbells—use a weight that’s challenging—and push them slightly over your head instead of straight up over your chest. Bring your hands back down, and complete three sets of 10 to 12 reps with 90 seconds of rest between each set.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Shapely Behinds</h3>



<p>Blame Kim Kardashian. Enlarging the backside is now an increasingly requested cosmetic surgery—though there are other ways to get a lift.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Most Dramatic: No Butts About It</h4>



<p>One way to fill out a flat or saggy posterior is a&nbsp;<strong>Brazilian Butt Lift.</strong>&nbsp;Performed on its own or with buttock implants, it provides double benefits: A surgeon removes unwanted fat from elsewhere in the body (commonly the hips, thighs, or belly) and uses that fat to smooth, shape, and elevate the derriere.</p>



<p>“Unless you’re very thin, you can get a lot more volume with fat transfer as opposed to implants, and the results are excellent when performed on someone with flat buttocks,” says Banks.</p>



<p>The procedure is lengthy—two to three hours—because the relocated fat needs to be put in drop by drop so it can survive. Expect bruising and swelling plus four to six weeks of wearing a compression garment.&nbsp;<em>Cost: $8,000 to $10,000.</em></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Exercise Option for a Shaplier Bottom</h4>



<p>A round, lifted rear requires targeting all three of the main glute muscles, preferably at the same time. “<strong>Squats and lunges</strong>&nbsp;of all kinds—using a barbell or dumbbells, wide or narrow stance, deep, partial, and plyometric—are all great for shaping the butt,” says trainer Cheryl Davis.</p>



<p>Her favorite lunge is a walking dumbbell lunge with a single-leg deadlift. Start by standing in a neutral position holding a dumbbell in each hand. Lunge forward with the right foot, placing most of the weight in that heel, then bend both knees until they form 90-degree angles. At the bottom of the lunge, squeeze through the glutes to return to standing, then shift the weight into the right foot, keeping the knee straight. Lift the left leg off the ground while lowering the dumbbells and torso toward the ground until the upper body is parallel to the floor. Return to standing and repeat on the other leg. Davis suggests three sets of ten reps on each leg, using a weight heavy enough to make the last two reps on each leg a challenge.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Toned Legs</h3>



<p>Although there are still few cosmetic treatments available to sculpt legs, these are some options for thighs, knees, and calves:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Worth the Shot?</h4>



<p>A gold standard of fat removal continues to be laser-assisted liposuction, but there’s a new—albeit controversial—injectable that’s reported to dissolve fatty bulges in the legs, stomach, hips, and back.&nbsp;<strong>Aqualyx</strong>&nbsp;contains desoxycholan acid, a bile acid similar to what the liver naturally produces to aid the digestion of fat. The substance locks onto fat-cell walls and forces the cell to release stored fatty acid, which is then metabolized by the body.</p>



<p>If you’re generally fit but have spots of stubborn fat, such as outer-thigh bulges, Aqualyx can be injected into these areas, often combined with a local anesthetic such as lidocaine for a more comfortable experience. The treatment is relatively painless—patients feel a warm sensation, some itching, and slight burning. Expect some swelling and redness for one to three days.</p>



<p>“Most people need three to five sessions, at four-week intervals, to see a change,” says Banks. “But it depends on the size of the fat deposit, and every individual will have their own response to the solution.”</p>



<p>Not everyone is a fan. “Because it is injected subcutaneously, Aqualyx isn’t well controlled as to how far it diffuses, and I see the potential for areas of skin depressions,” says plastic surgeon Rondi Walker.</p>



<p>The procedure is said to be popular in England&nbsp;<em>(where it costs the equivalent of $400 to $600)</em>, but it’s just hitting the United States and is not FDA-approved.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Quick and Easy</h4>



<p>Age, sun exposure, and years of wear and tear can cause the skin on your legs to sag.</p>



<p>“Ironically, the more toned and fit you are, the more the skin on the upper thighs hangs, because there’s less fat to fill it out and support it,” West says.</p>



<p>Ultherapy, the ultrasound procedure, was recently shown to provide significant tightening of the skin on thighs, with improvements that continue for up to six months. A recent study also showed dramatic tightening in the knee area.&nbsp;<em>Cost: $2,000 to $3,500.</em></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Fake It</h4>



<p>The easiest way to make legs look younger? Use both a moisturizer and a bronzer—darker, hydrated legs appear firmer.</p>



<p>One product to try is&nbsp;<strong>Murad Body Firming Cream</strong>&nbsp;<em>($45)</em>, with vitamin C, soy, and shea butter. We can’t say we saw a 40-percent increase in firmness within 15 minutes of applying it (as the brand claims its studies show), but there was definitely an improvement. Maximize the effect by applying an imperfection-covering bronzer such as&nbsp;<strong>Lorac TANtalizer Body Bronzing Spray</strong>&nbsp;<em>($32),</em>&nbsp;which offers streak-free color.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sculpted Arms</h3>



<p>As more celebrities sport buff arms, the number of upper-arm lifts, or brachioplasties, has risen by more than 4,000 percent since the year 2000, from around 300 to more than 15,000, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. But surgery isn’t the only way to get toned arms.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Big Fix: Clipping “Bat wings”</h4>



<p>Upper arms are yet another area where we’d all be better off with thicker skin. Combine thin skin with age-related muscle loss—plus the fact we don’t use our triceps often during day-to-day activities—and you can develop dreaded “bat wings.”</p>



<p>When a large weight loss has left a lot of excess skin, you can’t get rid of that no matter how often you hit the gym. “A&nbsp;<strong>brachioplasty</strong>&nbsp;is the only way to reshape the underside of sagging upper arms due to excess skin and fat,” says Banks. The downside: The scar is noticeable—running from elbow to armpit.&nbsp;<em>Cost: $5,000 to $7,700.</em></p>



<p>When arm jiggle is due more to fat than to loose skin, some physicians recommend&nbsp;<strong>ultrasonic or laser-assisted liposuction,</strong>&nbsp;which liquefies and removes excess fat—and may tighten skin by heating the tissue.&nbsp;<em>Cost: $4,000 to $8,000 for both arms.</em></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Quicker, Easier Options for Arms</h4>



<p>For those with a mild to moderate amount of bothersome arm fat,&nbsp;<strong>CoolSculpting,&nbsp;</strong>an FDA-cleared process, freezes fat cells to eliminate them without causing damage to surrounding cells or tissue. While it reduces fatty tissue by about 20 percent, it won’t improve skin laxity. Results are visible within three weeks but most drastic after two months.&nbsp;<em>Cost: $3,000 for both arms.</em></p>



<p>If the issue isn’t fat but a bit of jiggly skin, some doctors recommend Ultherapy ultrasound treatments (mentioned previously for firming loose belly skin). Radio-frequency options such as&nbsp;<strong>PelleFirm</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Protégé Elite</strong>&nbsp;can also be used on arms to tighten skin; they use heat to stimulate collagen production. Ultherapy requires one treatment&nbsp;<em>(at about $2,000)</em>&nbsp;for both arms; the RF procedures require three to four treatments, two weeks apart&nbsp;<em>($400 to $500 each)</em>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Fake It</h4>



<p>For a mild, temporary skin-tightening effect available over the counter, it’s hard to beat&nbsp;<strong>Bliss Fatgirlslim Armcandy</strong>&nbsp;<em>($38)</em>. The product, applied with a massage applicator, includes lactic acid (which exfoliates smooth skin) and caffeine (which the company claims helps firm and tone).</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Exercise Option for Toning Arms</h4>



<p>To sculpt arms, says personal trainer Cheryl Davis, you have to work the muscles both in front (biceps) and back (triceps). She suggests performing two exercises back to back, with no rest in between: incline bicep curls and overhead arm extensions.</p>



<p>Start with an incline bicep curl: Stand with your back against a wall, holding dumbbells down at your sides. Next, walk your feet forward so that only your back is against the wall and the rest of your body is at a 45-degree angle. Curl both dumbbells up, keeping your elbows and upper arms against your sides. Squeeze your biceps at the top of the movement, then return the dumbbells to the starting position. Repeat 15 times.</p>



<p>For the overhead arm extension, stand up straight and hold one dumbbell in both hands directly over your head. Slowly lower the dumbbell toward the back of your head, as if you’re trying to touch your shoulder blades. Return the dumbbell to the starting position, squeezing through your triceps once the dumbbell is directly overhead. Repeat 15 times. After a brief rest, perform two more sets of both exercises.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Many Sizes Do You Lose With A Tummy Tuck</h2>



<p>Do you feel self-conscious about loose skin hanging from your abdomen? Have you lost a great deal of weight but still feel unhappy because you now have excess abdominal skin? Do you wish you could lose a bit of belly fat? If so, you may be considered a good candidate for a tummy tuck, also known as abdominoplasty. Today, our aesthetic experts at the office of Dr. Bruce Kadz in Beverly Hills, CA are looking at how many sizes you can lose post-op.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HOW MANY SIZES DO YOU LOSE WITH A TUMMY TUCK?</h2>



<p>You can generally expect to lose between two and three pants sizes following abdominoplasty. However, if you have a great deal of excess skin and you combine this procedure with liposuction, you may be able to lose four or more pants sizes. We can give you a better idea of how many pants sizes you can expect to lose during your initial consultation. Everyone has a different amount of excess abdominal skin and fat, so individual results vary.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">HOW MUCH WEIGHT CAN YOU LOSE WITH ABDOMINOPLASTY?</h3>



<p>Typically, people lose around five pounds if they get a complete abdominoplasty. If they opt for a partial abdominoplasty, they can expect to lose no more than three pounds. If liposuction is added to a tuck, it is possible to lose closer to 15 pounds. This is because up to 11 pounds of excess fat can be removed safely during most liposuction procedures. The exact amount of fat that can be removed safely depends on one’s starting weight.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TUMMY TUCK?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A complete abdominoplasty, sometimes referred to as a full tuck, is a body contouring procedure that involves improving the appearance of the upper and lower abdomen. This is accomplished by removing excess skin and tightening loose skin below and above the navel. A small amount of excess fat may also be excised during this procedure. An extended tuck is similar, but it also improves the contours of the back and hips.</p>



<p>A partial abdominoplasty, sometimes referred to as a mini tuck, is a body contouring procedure that involves improving the appearance of only the lower abdomen. This procedure may be ideal for you if you do not have concerns about your abdominal walls; the abdominal muscles themselves are only tightened during a full or extended tuck. A bit of excess fat can be excised, but it is not a fat removal procedure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HOW LONG WILL MY PROCEDURE TAKE?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>It usually takes around 2.5 hours to perform a full tuck, not including the preparation time or the observation period required after the procedure. All told, if you want to improve the appearance of your upper and lower abdomen, you need to be in our office for roughly 3.5 hours. If you also need quite a bit of excess fat removed, your total appointment time may be closer to 4.5 hours.</p>



<p>We can give you a better idea of how long your procedure will take when you come in for your initial consultation and discuss all of your aesthetic goals. Sometimes, people find that they need other procedures, like an arm lift or liposuction to remove excess chest fat, to achieve their desired aesthetic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HOW LONG WILL MY RECOVERY TAKE?</h2>



<p>You can expect most of your recovery to be complete within a week or two of your procedure. This is about how long you will need to take off from work, regardless of whether you get a full tuck, an extended tuck, or a tummy tuck combined with liposuction. How long you have to take off from work depends on how physically demanding your job is and whether your duties can be modified temporarily.</p>



<p>However, you should keep in mind that restrictions will be replaced on your usual activities for six to eight weeks. Specifically, you need to be prepared to take a couple of months off from lifting heavy weights or engaging in any other strenuous physical activity. The more you focus on your rest in the early stages of your recovery, the sooner you will be able to get back to doing what you love safely.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">HOW MUCH SHOULD I DRINK DURING MY RECOVERY PERIOD?</h3>



<p>A good goal to aim for is to drink at least 64 ounces of water and tea daily during your recovery period. However, you should adjust your fluid intake up or down depending on the color of your urine. It should be pale. If it is dark, try drinking more hydrating fluids or snack on a water-dense fruit or vegetable. If it is clear, you are overhydrating and should take a break from drinking for a while.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">SHOULD I EXERCISE AFTER MY PROCEDURE?</h3>



<p>The day after your procedure, you should start making a point to go for gentle walks. However, you should keep in mind while going on your gentle walks that your pulse should not be too elevated, and it is very important to rest whenever your body tells you that it needs rest. It may take a few days before you’re walking like you were before your procedure. Just be patient with yourself, and take as many breaks as you need to.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">HOW MUCH SLEEP SHOULD I TRY TO GET?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>You should try to get nine hours of consecutive sleep each night during your recovery. Usually, adults need around 7.5 hours of sleep per night, but you need a lot more rest during your recovery period because your skin needs to heal itself after the incisions are made. Most of this healing takes place during the rapid eye movement stage of the sleep cycle.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is the final stage, and you have to complete all of the earlier stages to get there. If you wake up in the middle of the night, regardless of which stage you were in when you woke up, you have to start over at the first stage of the sleep cycle. If you find that you can’t sleep nine hours in a row, try to get 7.5 hours of consecutive sleep and take a 90-minute nap during the day.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">WHAT SHOULD I EAT AFTER MY PROCEDURE?</h3>



<p>It isn’t just important that you eat fruits and veggies to stay hydrated during your recovery period. It is also important that you eat plenty of protein so your skin can produce enough collagen. Collagen is a protein that is responsible for many functions, including skin tightening and skin healing. Try to get between 50 and 60 grams of protein in your diet every day, and make sure you’re getting your recommended daily allowance of vitamin C.</p>



<p>Protein consumption is crucial because protein is made up of amino acids. Your body can break down protein into usable components (amino acids) and use that material to build the type of protein it needs (collagen). However, you should keep in mind that your body also needs vitamin C to produce collagen. Also, you should make sure you are getting plenty of soluble fiber in your diet. Certain analgesics may affect bowel movements in some people.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AM I A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR A TUMMY TUCK?</h2>



<p>If you are in fairly good health, there is a good chance that you will qualify for abdominoplasty. However, you must attend an initial evaluation to find out for sure whether this procedure is appropriate for you. If you suffer from certain medical conditions, including heart problems, lung problems, and bleeding disorders, you will not be considered a good candidate for abdominoplasty.</p>



<p>The best candidate for this procedure is an individual who is concerned about the appearance of their abdominal region and does not plan to become pregnant in the future. Often, this procedure is used to repair and tighten the abdominal walls after they have been damaged durign pregnancy or childbirth. A follow-up procedure may be necessary in the future if you become pregnant after getting a tuck.</p>
