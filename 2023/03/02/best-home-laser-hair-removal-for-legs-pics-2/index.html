<p><figure class="wp-block-image">   <h2>Best Home Laser Hair Removal For Legs Pics</h2>   <p>This top rated, editor’s pick laser hair removal device is a huge 50 per cent off right now. Image: Braun.</p>   <p>If you’re a fan of laser hair removal, you’ll know two things. The first is that it’s great for getting rid of hair long term, and the second is that it can very expensive.</p>   <p>If letting your body hair grow free isn’t your thing but you don’t have the cash for a course of treatment, then it’s time to give at-home IPL (intense pulsed light) devices a whirl. While they aren’t cheap to buy outright, you can use them countless times and from the comfort of your home, too – and you’ll find that compared to professional laser sessions, you’ll get plenty more bang for your buck.</p>   <p>So how do they work exactly? Sydney-based dermatologist and fellow of The Australasian College of Dermatologists, Dr Adrian Lim, says similar to in-clinic laser hair removal treatments, at-home devices deliver “concentrated light energy that selectively targets hair follicles”.</p>   <p>“The hair follicle absorbs the light energy which gets converted to heat resulting in damage to the hair follicle,” Dr Lim tells <em>news.com.au</em>.</p>   <p><strong>BEST AT-HOME LASER HAIR REMOVAL DEVICES</strong></p>   <p>No matter your budget, we’ve rounded up our picks of the best at-home IPL devices to save you hundreds.</p>   <p><strong>BEST AT-HOME LASER HAIR REMOVAL DEVICE</strong></p>   <p><strong>Braun Silk Expert Pro 5 IPL, Shaver Shop, $799 (down from $1,349 &#8211; save $550)</strong></p>   <p>Braun Silk Export Pro 5 IPL Kit</p>   <p>This Braun IPL promises permanent hair reduction in as little as four weeks. The dermatologist accredited skin-safe device automatically adapts to your skin tone for optimal performance, and contains 400,000 flashes. It has tons of rave reviews on the Shaver Shop site, with an impressive five out of five star average, but don’t just take their word for it. Best Of writer Dani Maher gave the IPL a whirl, and here’s what she thought:</p>   <p>“In the past, I’ve considered professional laser, but I was always put off by the high price tag. So the idea of an at-home device that could help me get the job done more quickly and cheaply was very appealing.</p>   <p>The Braun Silk Expert Pro 5 IPL comes in a convenient travel case along with a precision head and plastic shaver. A brief flip through the instructions was all I needed to work out how to use it: You start by shaving the area you plan on lasering, so that the IPL can find the hair follicle without burning off excess hair (ouch). Then, you can hold the device against your skin, and the SensoAdapt sensor will automatically adjust the light intensity to suit your specific hair and skin colour. After that, simply run the device along the skin, holding down the main button to trigger the flashes.</p>   <p>I tried the device out on my legs, and found it pretty simple. From start to finish, each session took me no longer than 30 minutes, and that’s including shaving and me taking my leisurely time. I was worried that it would be painful, but I felt a tiny bit of heat at most. My only difficulty was navigating around the bonier parts of my legs, like my knees and towards my ankles, but switching to the precision head made this easier.</p>   <p>The flashes are really bright, so unless you want them imprinted behind your eyelids forever, wear a pair of sunnies while you use the device (you’ll look a bit ridiculous, but your eyes will thank you).</p>   <p>After only three sessions with the device, I definitely began to notice that the regrowth of my hair was slowing down. Usually, my legs would be spiky again after a day or two, but I already started seeing a few more days of smoothness after using the IPL for just a few sessions. I’m only up to my fifth treatment (and you may need 10 to 12 weeks of use to permanently slow down regrowth), but I’m already really impressed with the results, and would definitely recommend it to those who are sick of having to shave every other day to stay smooth. Spending a bit more time and money now will save you so much in the long run, and future you will be grateful!”</p>   <p><strong>THE NEXT BEST THING</strong></p>   <p><strong>Braun Silk Expert Pro 3 IPL Long Term Hair Removal Device, $399 (down from $849)</strong></p>   <p>Braun Silk Expert Pro 3 IPL Long Term Hair Removal Device</p>   <p>If the Braun Silk Expert Pro 5 is a little out of reach in terms of budget, the brand also has a brilliant, more affordable option. The Braun Silk Expert Pro 3 boasts 300,000 flashes (the above Braun Silk Expert Pro 5 features 400,000) which will deliver you around 16 years of treatment which we think you’ll agree is pretty decent for the price. Reviews praise the IPL device for it’s comfortability and results, with one writing: “I bought this three weeks ago as I was over shaving. I’ve only done three sessions so far and already seeing results! The hair growth is now much slower… Amazing, would 100 per cent recommend.”</p>   <ul id="U702281981960VB"><li>The device’s three different intensity levels ensure the light adapts to your own individual skin tonePrecision head is brilliant for tackling those trickier areas like your bikini line, underarms or face.Comes with a Venus Divine Sensitive razor for pre-treatment shaving.</li></ul>      <p><strong>BEST FACE AND BODY IPL HAIR REMOVAL DEVICE<br>Happy Skin Co Gen.2 IPL Hair Removal Handset, THE ICONIC, $299</strong></p>   <p>Happy Skin Co Gen.2 IPL Hair Removal Handset. Image: Happy Skin Co.</p>   <p>With almost 3,000 reviews and an average rating of 4.7 out of 5, Happy Skin Co’s Gen.2 IPL Handset is definitely one to try. The sleek and ergonomic design comes with great power to zap those hairs in a flash. “Bought this a few months ago and have been loving it,” writes one five-star reviewer. “Took a few weeks for me to see the results but after the sixth week, I could really see the difference. Now I have finished my 12 week cycle and am just doing my touch up sessions as needed.”</p>   <ul id="U702281981960nHB"><li>There are five intensity levels, so you can adjust your treatment to suit your needs.The large light window allows you to treat larger areas in less time.12 month warranty</li></ul>      <p><strong>Remington i-Light Pro Face &amp; Body IPL, Myer, $799</strong></p>   <p>Remington i-Light Pro Face &amp; Body IPL.

Advancements in laser-based technologies have made the procedure a safer and better alternative to electrolysis.</p>   <p>Any laser-based treatment has the potential to yield undesired results. Common side effects of laser hair removal are swelling, redness, or irritation of the skin. All of which typically resolve on their own overtime without further intervention.</p>   <p>Laser hair removal is not a permanent hair removal solution, but with proper preparation results can last for years. Hair that does grow back will return thinner and more sparsely. To maximize your results, and limit any unwanted side effects, read through the following helpful tips on what to do before, during and after your treatment.</p>   <h4><strong>BEFORE LASER HAIR REMOVAL</strong></h4>   <p>Your laser hair removal appointment will begin with a consultation. This office visit can last anywhere from 10-20 minutes. During this time, your doctor will review your medical history, discuss your goals with you, and explain how the treatment works.</p>   <p>Laser hair removal is most successful for those with light skin and dark hair because this contrast helps the laser ‘see’ your hair. This doesn’t mean you can’t receive treatment if you have blond hair or dark skin. During your consultation, your doctor will help you weigh the risk versus benefits for your skin and hair type.</p>   <p>When you’re ready to begin treatment, the following pointers will help maximize your results. Of course, follow your doctor’s advice if it differs from these guidelines.</p>   <ul><li>Always go for an in-person consultation with your provider before committing to a treatment. An experienced provider will be able to assess your candidacy and estimate the number of treatments you may needDuring your consultation discuss the types of medications you are currently taking. Some prescriptions can cause photosensitivity, which can lead to burns.Stop using skincare products with strong ingredients like retinoids, salicylic acid, hydroxy acid, and benzoyl peroxide.Your treatment will be more successful if your legs are pale. Greater contrast between your skin and hair follicles yields better results. Schedule your treatment for the fall or winter, or avoid all forms of tanning (i.e. tanning from the natural sun, tanning beds, spray tans, and self-tanning products) for 6 weeks prior to your treatment. Laser treatments on tanned skin can result in long-term pigmentation issues.Avoid plucking, waxing, or bleaching your hair for 6 weeks prior to your appointment as plucking out hair by the root will decrease the effectiveness of your laser treatment.Shave the day before your treatment (as directed by your provider). Shaving encourages the hair follicle to enter its active growing stage which is the ideal stage for laser targeting. Within 24 hours of your appointment, shave the area(s) to be treated. Do not wax or pluck. Shaving removes longer hairs while keeping the root intact. It’s the root of the hair the laser targets, so the root must be present for your treatment to work best.Take a shower right before your appointment and clean the treatment area, making sure to remove dirt and oil from the skin. Avoid using any skincare products (including moisturizer) after you cleanse.Avoid lotions, oils, and deodorants prior to treatment. Arrive to your appointment with clean, dry skin. Moisturizers, creams, lotions, or oils can prevent the laser from accessing the root, as can sweat or other debris. If you are treating your underarms, avoid wearing deodorant until after your appointment.Follow your doctor’s orders and discontinue blood thinners, such as aspirin, anti-inflammatory medications, or antibiotics prior to your treatment. If you’ve taken any new medications since your consultation, let your doctor know.At least two weeks prior to your appointment, refrain from Botox and dermal fillers. Also, avoid any treatments that increase skin sensitivity such as microdermabrasion or chemical peels. In the week prior to your treatment, discontinue using products that cause photosensitivity.</li></ul>   <h4><strong>DURING YOUR LASER HAIR REMOVAL TREATMENT</strong></h4>   <p>During your laser hair removal appointment, your doctor or technician will review with you the area(s) to be treated. If you’re treating a bikini line or facial area, the technician may draw a line on your skin to indicate the treatment boundary.</p>   <p>The treatment area will be cleansed and prepared while your technician reminds you what to expect. Everyone experiences the sensation of laser hair removal differently. Most describe the feeling as similar to a rubber band being snapped against your skin. Your doctor may prepare the area with a numbing cream if pain is an issue for you.</p>   <p>While areas undergoing treatment must be exposed, all other areas of your body will be covered with your clothing or strategically placed sheets, similar to a massage. During treatment, everyone in the room will wear protective eye-wear, including you. This does not mean you won’t see flashes of the light, but you can rest assured your eyes are protected.</p>   <h4><strong>AFTER LASER HAIR REMOVAL</strong></h4>   <p>The most common, yet short-lived, side effect of laser hair removal is swelling and redness in the treatment area. For the first few hours, you might even feel like you have a mild sunburn. Swelling and redness should subside within 1-3 days. During this time, it’s safe to use aloe vera or topical cooling creams to reduce discomfort.</p>   <p>Your hair will not fall out immediately during treatment, but slowly over the following few weeks. Because each of our hair follicles are on separate growth cycles, it’s normal to experience some patchy re-growth. These areas will be treated at follow-up visits, until regrowth has been eliminated.</p>   <p>Make sure to follow these tips following your laser hair removal treatment session:</p>   <p>Attend any scheduled follow-up or maintenance treatments as directed by your provider in a timely manner</p>   <p>Avoid the sun (and tanning beds) and wear a high-quality sunscreen as UV exposure can irritate the treated skin and complicate the hair removal process.</p>   <p>For the first 24-hours after your appointment, avoid all types of heat. Hot showers or baths, saunas, steam rooms, and exercise can lead to discoloration or infection. After 24 hours, it’s ok to return to the gym, but continue to avoid the sun for up to 2 weeks. UV light, including that from tanning beds, can lead to scarring or permanent pigmentation.</p>   <p>“Sun-less” tanning options like spray tans or self-tanning products can be used between treatment sessions as long as their use is discontinued 2 weeks prior to your next treatment.</p>   <p>Continue to shave, instead of plucking, tweezing, or waxing, if you need to remove hair between treatments</p>   <p>Gently exfoliate the treated skin 2-3 times per week using a loofah or washcloth. This minimizes the risk of developing ingrown hairs.</p>   <p>Keep the retinoids and hydroxy acids on hold for up to one week after your treatment. Instead, use a gentle cleanser and soothing, moisturizing lotion. Wait at least two weeks before scheduling microdermabrasion, chemical peels, Botox or dermal fillers.</p>   <p>Take lukewarm showers for the first week after your treatment</p>   <p>Avoid using perfumes or deodorants for 48 hours after your treatment</p>   <figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="603" height="383" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1811/5901/articles/jewelbelly_1024x.jpg?v=1558987456" alt="HPL and Laser Hair Removal for Private Parts"></figure>   <h2>Best Home Laser Hair Removal For Pubic Area</h2>   <p>At-home hair removal is a wonder. It’s safe, efficient, effective and affordable. Despite its growing popularity, these devices might not be the best option to remove hair from areas like the pubic region, groin, perianal and scrotum. Because of this, most people wind up using a sharp razor or depilatory cream made of harsh chemicals, which isn’t always the best method of hair removal for our more…sensitive body areas.</p>   <p>The technology that powers Silk’n devices—Home Pulsed Light (HPL)—is safe to use on most body areas, including your bikini line. If you wish to have hair-free private areas, then you need to commit to a specific treatment plan with the right method. Unfortunately, there isn’t a super cream on the market that removes hair from head to toe. </p>   <p>To help you out, we’re going to take a deep dive into how to supplement your Silk’n treatments so you can safely and cleanly remove hair from those hard to reach places. The aim is to help you create not only the best hair removal plan but also the safest.</p>   <p><strong>Pubic Hair Removal</strong></p>   <p>Having hair on your pubic and surrounding areas is your choice, and shouldn’t be influenced by outside opinions, advertising or societal pressure. It’s your call and one you should never have to defend.</p>   <p>Private parts is a broad terms that applies to several areas on men and women, including the pubic region, scrotum, groin, or perianal (surrounding the anus). These areas can be quite sensitive and lead to one feeling self-conscious about their body. Additionally, private part hair can impact intimacy or prevent you from wearing certain types of clothing.</p>   <p>For years, men and women have taken to grooming these areas as part of their personal style and to contribute to their hygiene. To do so, you need to conduct hair removal for your private parts more conscientiously than you would your underarms or legs. Private parts are naturally more sensitive, and most people would rather have a cut on their leg than on their testicular area (for obvious reasons!).</p>   <p>Private parts aren’t like other areas of your body. The skin is much more sensitive and requires different treatment to avoid stubble, irritated skin or bumps due to hair removal.</p>   <p><strong>The Basics of HPL Hair Removal</strong></p>   <p>Over a decade ago, Silk’n developed HPL as an at-home version of Intense Pulsed Light (IPL). The goal was to take the safety offered by professional clinics and spas and couple it with the efficacy of laser hair treatments. It was a true revelation, and since its inception, at-home hair removal has garnered millions of advocates across the globe.</p>   <p>The proprietary HPL delivers pulses of light energy that attacks hair at the root. The benefit is two-fold: it disables the hair forcing it to fall out and reduces the likelihood of regrowth. After a complete treatment, users should be able to enjoy permanently reduced hair in the target area or areas.</p>   <p>It functions based on the contrast between skin tone and hair color. The emitted beam of focused light targets melanin, which is typically found in the shaft, leaving skin unaffected and unharmed. The downside is that people with dark or fair skin and light hair will not experience success with a HPL-powered device.</p>   <p>It’s proven that HPL hair removal provides reliable results even in the cases of coarse hair. Despite its proficiency in this respect, it’s not an ideal tool for most private areas. It is recommended for the following body areas:</p>   <ul><li>Bikini lineLegsArmsUnderarmsForearmsShouldersBackFace (below the cheeks only)</li></ul>   <p>You might want to supplement your Silk’n treatment with other methods that can comfortably and safely remove hair from your private areas.
