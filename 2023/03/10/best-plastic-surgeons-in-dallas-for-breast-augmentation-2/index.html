<p>Breast augmentation is usually done as an outpatient procedure, but it may require overnight hospitalization depending on your health history, general anesthesia or local anesthesia with sedation, or intravenous sedation. You should expect some pain and swelling for about four to eight weeks after the surgery, which may make it difficult for you to perform certain activities such as driving a car or lifting heavy objects until your body has healed completely. Some women experience complications such as infection, bleeding or deflation of their implanted breast tissue due to trauma caused by sports injuries or other accidents</p>



<p>The breast augmentation procedure is a surgical procedure that enhances breast size, improves breast shape and lifts drooping breasts. It can be performed on women of all ages to help reshape their breasts or restore volume to sagging breasts after pregnancy, weight loss or aging. During this procedure, an incision is made in the breast tissue to insert an implant with a thin shell made of silicone or saline. The implant will be positioned behind the chest muscle and covered by the overlying skin and nipple-areola complex. The incisions are made in the fold under each breast and then closed with stitches that dissolve as they heal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Plastic Surgeons In Dallas For Breast Augmentation</h2>



<p><br>Dr. Adams is a Board-Certified plastic surgeon serving Dallas, Plano, and Fort Worth Areas in Texas.&nbsp;<strong>Ranked #1 for Breast Augmentation on Newsweek’s list of America’s Best Plastic Surgeons 2021.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">ABOUT BREAST AUGMENTATION SURGERY</h4>



<p>Dr. Adams specializes in breast and body contouring procedures and is world-renowned for his innovative 24-Hour Recovery Breast Augmentation approach. He offers all types of implants on a case-by-case basis, including cohesive silicone gel and saline. Our office utilizes an interactive pre-surgery 3D-imaging technology, enabling our patients to accurately see what they will look like after surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
<a></a>24 HOUR BREAST AUGMENTATION RECOVERY</h4>



<p>Dr. Adams has implemented several specific techniques that minimize tissue trauma, which decreases post-operative pain. This 24-Hour Rapid Recovery allows his patients to return to normal activities&nbsp;within 24 hours after surgery.</p>



<p>Everyone has their own personal reasons when considering breast augmentation. Some of these reasons include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enlarging the breasts to make the body proportional&nbsp;</li>



<li>Restoring breasts that have lost shape/volume due to breastfeeding or aging</li>



<li>Balancing the appearance of asymmetric breasts, differing in size or shape</li>
</ul>



<p>Whatever your reason, the breast augmentation journey is different for all…but recovery doesn’t have to be.</p>



<p>The average healing time for breast augmentation surgery is anywhere from four to six weeks. The common surgical approach requires money, pain, bulky bandaging, and excessive downtime. Many patients are advised to avoid physical exercise and refrain from resuming work or picking up their children; and it often requires prescriptions of narcotic pain killers. For many women, this adds complications to their personal lives, as friends and family must step in to help pick up the slack, while they rest and recover.</p>



<p>With Dr. Adams’ method for breast implant procedures, patients experience a true 24-hour recovery time. Dr. Adams accomplishes this by utilizing his&nbsp;<em>14-point plan</em>&nbsp;that is published in one of his academic textbooks,&nbsp;<em>“The&nbsp; Process of Breast Augmentation”</em>, along with unique surgical techniques that reduce overall trauma. This minimizes post-operative pain right away and dramatically shortens the recovery time. Instead of prescribing potentially addictive and dangerous narcotic pain medicines, Dr. Adams’ patients partake in a simple Ibuprofen regimen to aid in managing mild inflammation and muscle soreness. The initial pain level is comparable to ordinary discomfort after a strenuous upper-body workout.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Adams has documented this revolutionary 24-Hour Recovery process in peer-reviewed medical publications and is recognized worldwide by his expertise. Ninety-nine percent (99%) of his patients return to their normal routine within 24 hours or less. He encourages his patients to mobilize immediately after surgery through a series of light arm-raising exercises, which promotes muscle stimulation to decrease stiffness and swelling.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
<a></a>WHAT IS BREAST AUGMENTATION?</h4>



<p>Breast augmentation is a safe outpatient operation for improving shape and expanding size of the breasts. While it is considered to be a major procedure, insertion of the proper-sized implant under-the muscle / breast tissue, is minimally invasive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Breast augmentation enhances inherent breast dimensions and contour, and may give your body a more harmonious balance. Breast augmentation can also dramatically restore breast and body proportion after pregnancy. Furthermore, breast implant surgery may be performed in conjunction with a breast lift; and acceptable with specific breast cancer treatments or breast reconstruction procedures.</p>



<p>Beyond the physical advantages of this cosmetic procedure, it also provides psychological and personal benefits to the patient; confidence, improvement of overall health, empowerment, sexual satisfaction. Breasts are embraced as an essential, beautiful part of femininity.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
<a></a>ABOUT BREAST ANATOMY</h4>



<p>The breast is composed of fatty, glandular, and fibrous tissues. Within the breasts are blood vessels, milk ducts, fat glands, and sensory nerves, and a large inferior muscle called the Pectoralis Major. The size, shape, and integrity of women’s breasts vary and are affected by many factors such as age, past pregnancies, natural skin elasticity, and genetics. Some women have a deviation in proportions from right to left, which is called asymmetry.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<a></a>CONSULTATION &amp; BREAST IMPLANT SELECTION</h2>



<p>During the consultation, Dr. Adams will take specific measurements to determine the optimal implant size range and implant type that will fit your breast. These measurements are accurate and predictable, which allows for precise selection.</p>



<p>Our office aims for all patients to get the most out of their consultation experience. Dr. Adams will spend quality time listening to your concerns and make personalized recommendations that appeal to your desired outcome. As a leading expert, educator, and longtime researcher in cosmetic breast surgery,&nbsp; Dr. Adams ensures that you are receiving the best possible guidance and care.</p>



<p>Breast implants have evolved tremendously over time and with the cutting-edge technology we have to access today, they are more advanced than ever. Breast implants are in the Top 10 most studied and commonly used implantable medical devices in the nation. There is a wide variety of FDA approved implants; saline and silicone being the primary options. Saline implants are made up of a silicone outer shell, filled with sterile saline saltwater. Cohesive silicone implants are the most popular today due to their groundbreaking strength and natural appearance. They feature a silicone outer shell, and a viscous silicone-gel filling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Choosing the right implants is one of the most important aspects of the consultation process. It is imperative to pick the proper size and type of implant that is best for your anatomy. Dr. Adams encourages his patients to be open-minded to his professional suggestions and take time to gather the information they need, so they are confident with their final decision. Ultimately, choosing the appropriate implants will not only give you the best and safest result, but will also increase the longevity of those results.</p>



<p>The state-of-the-art 3D-imaging system we use in our office lets patients “try on” various shapes, profiles, and sizes of recommended breast implants. This helps with visualizing the final outcome and allows you to make a more informed decision.</p>



<p>The 3D-imaging device will scan your body and take multiple photographs from different angles. With powerful computer software, these photo scans are used to create an interactive life-like 3D model of your body. Dr. Adams will review customized options and show you what your breasts could look like with implants. This way, you’ll get a better understanding of which implant you’ll like best.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<a></a>CUP SIZE AND BREAST VOLUME</h2>



<p>Picking the right implant size can be confusing as breast implants are measured in Cubic Centimeters (cc), not bra cup sizes. This is because bra cup sizes are not standard—a C cup from one brand may be entirely different than a C cup from another. Furthermore, a C cup on one patient, may fit differently than a C cup on another patient. Cubic Centimeters are used as an accurate measuring standard. This gives both the surgeon and patient the knowledge needed for a more precise assessment.</p>



<p>If you’re in the Dallas Fort-Worth area of Texas, Dr. Adams has the ability to take&nbsp;3D scans of your breasts and virtually enhance them&nbsp;to show you how you may look after your surgery. Setup a consultation today to see how we can help!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Breast Augmentation Recovery And Results</h2>



<p>After an hour or so in the recovery room, you will be discharged to the care of another adult who needs to stay with you for the evening. You will need someone to bring you to your first post-operative recheck, since you should not drive a car for the first two days after breast enlargement surgery, or while taking pain medication. Virtually every patient can resume normal everyday activities within 24 hours after surgery, including showering, doing one’s hair or applying cosmetics, dressing, eating normal meals, and moving about the house. You should avoid stretching or repetitive activities that might raise your pulse or blood pressure, which can increase the risk of bleeding and re-operation. Our superior anesthesia protocols (TIVA), as well as careful, minimal-trauma surgery may allow most patients to feel well enough to go out for pizza on the way home from surgery, or to go dancing the next day. But really, this makes no sense, since every patient having an operation must heal tissues and seal blood vessels. The less strenuous activity you engage in, the less likelihood of bleeding, bruising, discomfort, capsular contracture, or re-operation. Taking things easy, even if you feel great, is an investment in your final cosmetic result! Anything else that seeks to imply a superior surgical skill, “special” technique, or proprietary way to circumvent normal healing is simply marketing.</p>

<p>You should avoid exercising, lifting, or strenuous activity for a full two weeks following surgery, to limit the possibility of bleeding. If you have bleeding, re-operation is necessary to remove the blood, cauterize or suture the source, and re-close the incision. Most patients prefer to reduce activities rather than risk re-operation and the higher rate of capsular contracture that may result if this occurs. This generally means no exercise or other strenuous activity for the first two weeks. Jogging, horseback riding, weightlifting (bench press, military press, curls, etc.), yoga, or any activities that bounce the breasts or stretch/contract the chest muscles should be avoided for a full month or longer, depending on intensity.</p>



<p>Breast augmentation–submuscular silicone implants</p>



<p>This 20 year-old woman came to Minneapolis Plastic Surgery for breast augmentation with implants. She underwent submuscular silicone gel implant placement as a light general (TIVA) anesthetic outpatient procedure in our nationally-accredited (AAAASF) on-site surgical facility. She returned to everyday (non-strenuous) activities in 24 hours, light exercise in 2 weeks, and more vigorous work-outs in 4 weeks. (Note the large mole in her cleavage area was removed at the time of her surgery; the small mole on the right breast remains.)</p>



<p>Breast augmentation–submuscular saline implants</p>



<p>This 47 year-old mother of 3 lost most of her breast volume after breast feeding, and came to Minneapolis Plastic Surgery for augmentation mammoplasty (breast enlargement with implants). Her surgery was one month before the FDA again released silicone gel implants for elective breast augmentation (2006), so this patient had submuscular saline implants placed. Proper “over”filling minimized implant rippling. Her TIVA general anesthetic allowed her to leave the recovery room in just one hour&#8211;alert, comfortable, and without nausea or vomiting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Minneapolis Plastic Surgery Patient Recovery</h2>



<p>Some breast augmentation surgeons or websites state or imply that they utilize special techniques to minimize postoperative pain, swelling, or restriction of activities. One website even emphasizes the implied “superiority” of their procedure by showing a photograph of a breast enlargement patient out dancing with her arms above her head shortly after surgery, or by showing testimonials by patients who go out to dinner the night after surgery.&nbsp;<strong>We also employ all of these “special” techniques, and in fact 97-98 percent of Minneapolis Plastic Surgery’s breast enhancement patients have NO nausea, NO vomiting, NO anesthetic hangover, and are able to eat normal food and be up and about the night after surgery.</strong>&nbsp;Do we encourage dancing and dining the night after surgery? Of course not; there still are the two-three percent of patients who will have some degree of nausea or more discomfort, and do best by minimizing the potential for raising the blood pressure that accompanies vomiting, and the risk of re-operation or capsular contracture that goes with elevating the blood pressure or pulse. Most of our breast enhancement patients are thrilled by their lack of post-operative pain, bruising, or swelling, not to mention the avoidance of nausea and vomiting our superior anesthesia techniques permit! But we want ALL of our patients to have a great result, so we recommend moderation in activities that might adversely impact your result (and our reputation).</p>



<p>Although limitation of strenuous activity requirements are simple, straightforward, and in your best interest, a few patients each year feel they can bypass this rule, think they are doing so well that this doesn’t apply to them, or decide that they “got away with (an inappropriate activity) once, so it must be OK,” and end up in the operating room again.&nbsp; This is usually avoidable, but bleeding can still occur despite everyone’s (patient and surgeon) best effort. If this is the case, timely re-operation can remove the blood (usually only a few ounces), control the bleeding source, and avoid or limit any untoward effect on the final result.&nbsp;<strong>If you have significant swelling on one or both sides post-operatively, notify your surgeon.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Avoiding Infection</h2>



<p>Infection is extremely rare in this operation. It can occur, however, and you must take the prescribed antibiotics until gone to reduce this risk as much as humanly possible. If an implant becomes infected, it must be removed (usually with the other implant, infected or not) and will need to be left out for several weeks to as long as a year, to allow all bacteria to be destroyed by antibiotic therapy and your own antibodies, as well as to allow scar tissue to soften enough to permit replacement of the implants.</p>



<p>You can also reduce the risk of infection by showering rather than bathing, and you should absolutely stay out of the lake, Jacuzzi, pool, hot tub, or sauna for&nbsp;three weeks&nbsp;after breast enlargement surgery. Close contact with animals or household pets (especially cats) should be limited as well during this time. Taking your antibiotics as prescribed does not eliminate the need to follow these recommendations!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Typical Breast Augmentation Recovery Prescriptions</h2>



<p>You will also receive prescriptions for muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatory before you leave our Clinic (these are now e-prescribed and can be picked up prior to surgery so you don’t have to stop on the way home after surgery!) In our office, pain medication cannot be “called-in” or e-scribed–on the day of surgery your adult caregiver will be given a written prescription for these medications. Take your medication as advised to reduce nausea, vomiting, and the resultant increase of blood pressure that might start bleeding. Your breasts will NOT have drains (they are not necessary with our precise surgical technique and meticulous hemostasis), but you will have a long-acting local anesthetic placed in your implant pocket to minimize immediate post-operative discomfort. We also inject a 3-4 day extended-release local anesthetic (Exparel) into the tissue around your breasts to reduce discomfort for an extended period. This multi-pronged approach is why the vast majority of our breast enlargement patients do so well and report minimal post-op discomfort.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Typical Breast Augmentation Activity Recommendations</h2>



<p><em>Keep fluid intake up and walk, move around, and flex your calf muscles to reduce the risk of blood clots. This is important to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, pulmonary embolism, or sudden death.</em>&nbsp;Do not take aspirin, ibuprofen, Aleve&#x2122;, etc. during the four weeks after surgery. Resume other medications as advised by your doctor. Return to work based on the activity levels required at your job, and resume exercise or strenuous activity gradually, no sooner than the two weeks discussed above. Jogging, horseback riding, weightlifting, vigorous sexual activity, or similar strenuous exertion should be avoided for four weeks to decrease the risk of bleeding, re-operation, and/or capsular contracture.</p>



<p><strong>Your bleeding risk is actually highest 10 to 33 days AFTER surgery, as pain and soreness resolve, and activities naturally increase.</strong>&nbsp;Healing tissues are not durable and supple enough for vigorous stretching or strenuous muscular contraction until one month from surgery, and then only if started gradually. This information is meant to help you avoid re-operation for bleeding! (And those “quick-recovery” “brand-name” operations don’t have any magical stop-bleeding tricks either—in fact, implying activity is OK or encouraged only increases these doctors’ re-operation rates for evacuation of hematomas.) Ask who pays for that?&nbsp; Hospital charges for bleeding re-operation can cost thousands; we offer minimal-cost, no surgeon’s fee&nbsp; re-operation (around $1000) in the unlikely event that one of our patients bleeds.</p>



<p>Following these recommendations will make the likelihood of a successful outcome as high as possible, and the risk of complications low. After your breast enlargement surgery, your final appearance will take some time to be achieved. During this time your muscle, breast tissue, and skin must heal, stretch, soften, and settle over time. Some patients look fabulous days after surgery; most take somewhat longer!</p>



<p>Most patients are sent home with a Velcro® bandeau placed on the upper part of the breasts. This will be worn at night, and in most cases, patients will be asked to remain braless during the day. This will allow your breast implants to drop into the proper position over time. The amount of time necessary for final softening and settling of implant position is different for each patient, and so will the time recommended to start wearing a bra. Some patients will have tapes and a surgical bra right after surgery. Do not judge your recovery by the yardstick of a friend’s or relative’s experience; every patient is unique, and every recovery and result is also unique. Your surgeon will guide you as time goes by and advise you on how to enhance your result. At Minneapolis Plastic Surgery, Ltd. we offer our patients a lifetime of no-charge rechecks and will keep you apprised of the best advice we are capable of giving.</p>



<p>Most patients look good in clothing within days after surgery; unclothed, a soft, natural appearance will take longer to develop. Final softening, settling, and the return of sensation can take several months to as long as a year or so. During this time, or at least as long as your scars are pink, you must avoid tanning booths or any source of ultraviolet exposure in order to reduce the chance of permanently darkening the scars. Vitamin E oil or ointment massage of the scars&nbsp;after three week’s time&nbsp;can help to soften and fade them; you should not begin this prior to three weeks after surgery in order to avoid the risk of prematurely softening and stretching the scars. If you have a tendency to form thick or heavy scars, your surgeon may instruct you in the use of scar pads ( silicone sheets ) or other scar-treatment remedies as&nbsp; ways of helping to reduce this concern.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Smooth Recovery Process</h2>



<p>All in all, with superior anesthesia, careful surgery, meticulous technique, precise hemostasis, attention to medications, not resuming strenuous activity prematurely, and equally attentive patient compliance, breast enlargement is a safe, straightforward procedure with a very high satisfaction rate. This information and these recommendations are not intended to be complete or all-inclusive. Post-operative rechecks are important and are designed to monitor your progress, make appropriate recommendations, and address any specific concerns or questions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Natural looking breast implants</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cosmeticsurgerytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-12985.png" alt="" class="wp-image-82828"></figure>



<p>Breast augmentation&nbsp;continues to be one of the most commonly performed cosmetic surgery operations in the UK, with over 2000 procedures carried out in London each year. Breast enlargement surgery is designed to alter the size and shape of the breast with an improvement in breast texture.</p>



<p>Breast implants come in two main types, silicone implants or saline implants. Saline implants are composed of a silicone outer and are filled with a sterile saltwater solution (saline). In contrast, silicone implants are composed of a cohesive gel-like material enclosed by a silicone shall. Saline implants are rarely used in the UK due to the high risk of implant rupture and the inability to achieve natural-looking results. There are also more prone to developing implant rippling, which may be visible through the skin. Silicone breast implants are most commonly used in the UK and have a more natural consistency with a reduced likelihood of developing implant rippling or wrinkling. All types of breast implants have a finite lifespan of approximately 10 to 15 years, and it is recommended to have them removed or replaced at this time. Some women may also want to improve the size and shape of their breasts after a period of time due to the development of breast sagging, and different-sized implants, whether bigger or smaller, may be used to replace old breast implants.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Which types of breast implants look natural?</h2>



<p>We commonly get asked how women can achieve a natural look with breast implants. There are several different ways to ensure a natural-looking appearance with breast implants.</p>



<p>Getting natural-looking results with breast augmentation</p>



<p>The first step is to have a consultation with an expert breast augmentation surgeon at Centre for Surgery. At the consultation, your surgeon will assist you in helping to select the most appropriate type of implant to match your chest anatomy. We offer two different brands of breast implants, including Mentor and Sebbin implants. Both types of implants are MHRA-approved for breast augmentation and have a proven track record of safety and quality. Implants come in various sizes and shapes, including round implants, anatomical implants or teardrop implants.</p>



<p>Implants also come in a variety of different profiles, from low profile to very high profile. Implant profile is used to describe the distance of projection from the chest, with low profile implants having a more shallow edge resulting in a more natural appearance. Very high-profile implants project further outwards with more defined edges and help improve breast cleavage. High-profile implants have a lower potential for creating a natural appearance but are often preferred by many patients who want to achieve bigger breasts with enhanced cleavage.</p>



<p>Your surgeon will also discuss optimal breast implant placement with two main techniques for placing the implants, which can be either below the pectoralis muscle or placed on top of the muscle. There are pros and cons to both approaches depending on your desired look. Achieving a natural appearance to the breasts will often depend on where the implants are placed, and you can discuss this further with your surgeon at the consultation.</p>



<p>Natural-looking breast implants can be enhanced further with the addition of fat transfer to the breasts, which is an effective technique for disguising the edges of the implant in thin-skinned patients.</p>



<p>Following the post-operative instructions after breast augmentation surgery is essential to get the best results. You will be provided with a post-operative support bra to maintain the breast implants in the correct position and avoid unnecessary irritation of the healing scars.</p>



<p>We would advise avoiding certain types of strenuous exercise, including cardiovascular exercises and sporting activities such as tennis, which involve raising your arms above your shoulder level. Excessive movements of the arms above the shoulders may result in a risk of developing implant malposition. This complication may require corrective breast surgery further down the line. Avoiding excessive arm movements will also help your breast augmentation scars to heal properly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can breast implants look fake?</h2>



<p>Fake-looking breast implants often have several characteristics. Choosing very high-profile implants often results in breasts that appear less natural. The position of the implant can also play a factor in creating breast implants that look fake, whether the implant is placed above the breast muscle or beneath it.</p>



<p>The anatomy of the female chest and the size of the breast implant selected can often determine whether breast enhancement results appear fake. Women who only go up one or 2 cup sizes after breast augmentation surgery have a higher likelihood of achieving natural-looking results than women who go up 5 or 6 breast cup sizes. If you are keen to achieve a natural-looking breast augmentation, please discuss this with your surgeon, who will be able to use years of experience in helping you select implants that will appear natural for your body shape.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the most natural breast implant?</h2>



<p>Compared with saline implants, silicone breast implants have the most natural-looking appearance and optimum feel. At Centre for Surgery, we have extensive experience with Sebbin breast implants manufactured in France. These implants have over 20 years of safety data proving their effectiveness. Sebbin implants contain a highly cohesive silicone gel contained in an outer silicone shell. Patients often tell us how the implants feel similar to the natural breast tissue. Successful breast augmentation surgery to achieve a natural appearance depends on choosing the correct implant size, shape and profile, which must always be customised to each patient to get optimal results.</p>



<p>What kind of breast implant is right for you?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are there any natural alternatives to breast implants?</h2>



<p>Breast augmentation&nbsp;with implants is the most common method of surgically enhancing the breasts. However,&nbsp;fat transfer breast augmentation&nbsp;has emerged as a highly effective way to enhance breast volume without the need for implants.</p>



<p>Centre for Surgery experts in all types of&nbsp;fat transfer surgery, including breast augmentation fat transfer which involves enhancing breast volume by injecting fat into the breasts. Many patients often prefer having breast augmentation with fat transfer as the procedure does not involve the use of artificial substances such as silicone implants and is known for producing natural-looking results.</p>



<p>What are the natural alternatives to breast implants?</p>



<p>Natural breast augmentation with fat transfer to breast involves&nbsp;liposuction&nbsp;to remove fat from unwanted body areas such as the abdomen, thighs or hips, followed by its purification. The purified fat is then injected into the breasts using small diameter cannulas. Many patients appreciate having areas of stubborn fat removed to contour and sculpt body regions such as the stomach. This procedure is often viewed as a two-in-one procedure with the body contouring benefits of liposuction combined with breast fat transfer to increase breast volume in the same procedure. Natural breast augmentation with fat transfer results in fewer scars compared with breast implant surgery.</p>



<p>The risk of complications such as bleeding is much less with breast fat transfer than with breast implant surgery. Not having implants inserted means any risk of infection is minimal. Fat transfer breast augmentation is commonly requested by patients who may be unhappy with the results of a breast implant procedure. Some patients may have had surgery for breast cancer, such as a mastectomy and will require&nbsp;breast reconstruction surgery&nbsp;to restore the shape of the breasts and&nbsp;get rid of breast asymmetry.</p>



<p>Fat transfer breast augmentation is most commonly carried out under a general anaesthetic. At Centre for Surgery, we specialise in TIVA anaesthesia to ensure a quick recovery with minimal risk of post-operative sickness. The procedure takes, on average, between one and three hours, depending on the amount of liposuction carried out and the quantity of fat injected into the breasts.</p>



<p>The recovery time after that transfer to breasts is generally between one week and four weeks. Your surgeon may recommend taking one week off work and restricting physical activities until any post-operative swelling has settled down, which will help improve the quality of your recovery. Once you have seen your surgeon at your six-week review, you may undertake complete activities without restrictions.</p>



<p>Fat transfer to the breasts can be carried out with or without breast implant surgery. When breast fat transfer is combined with breast implants, the procedure is called&nbsp;hybrid breast augmentation. By combining the two procedures, patients can benefit by having a significant increase in breast volume with implants with the natural-looking results achievable with fat transfer. Liposuction can be carried out to other body areas if desired to create a flatter stomach or slimmer-looking thighs.</p>



<p>Some of our surgeons are experienced in 3-D virtual imaging to give you an idea of how you could look after your breast implant surgery. 3-D imaging may help you develop a better idea of what can be achieved and whether your expectations are realistic.</p>
