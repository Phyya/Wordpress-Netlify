<p>Zeros is one of the best home laser hair removal machines for Indian skin. It&#8217;s been specifically designed to be used on darker skin tones, so you can be sure that it won&#8217;t burn or damage your skin. It&#8217;s also very easy to use—just plug it in, turn it on, and press a button to start removing unwanted hair from your body.</p>



<p>The Zeros device is battery-powered and comes with two batteries so you can use it as soon as you get it. The batteries last for a long time and are easy to replace when they run out of power. The Zeros device works by emitting pulses of laser light that are absorbed by dark pigments in your hair follicles and then converted into heat energy. This heat energy destroys your follicles&#8217; ability to grow new hairs, leaving you with smooth, hairless skin for up to six weeks at a time!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Home Laser Hair Removal For Indian Skin Zeros</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m not here to tell you that you should or shouldn&#8217;t remove your body hair—I support whatever you want to do. But if you&#8217;ve decided you want less of it and you want a removal option that&#8217;ll last longer than a few days,&nbsp;laser hair removal&nbsp;is the way to go. Yes, it&#8217;s an investment (sessions can range from $30 to $100 depending on the area), but after getting Brazilian waxes for about 10 years, it definitely made more sense for me to pay more upfront for more permanent hair reduction and spend less time trying to mediate in butterfly position while someone ripped hard wax off of my vagina.</p>



<p>As I began researching laser hair removal options, I noticed that in general, useful information is scarce—and useful information for people with melanin-rich skin is even rarer. So, after doing tons of research, embarking on my own &#8220;journey,&#8221; and chronicling my experiences on Instagram Stories, I figured there needed to be a more permanent and visible place for others to get all the deets on laser hair removal for dark skin.</p>



<p>This guide contains all the information I wish I had before committing to laser hair removal with tips from myself and most importantly, from board-certified dermatologists who specialize in working with melanin-rich skin.<a href="https://www.wellandgood.com/acne-scar-treatments/"></a><a href="https://www.wellandgood.com/acne-scar-treatments/"></a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How laser hair removal works</h2>



<p>&#8220;Laser hair removal is the process by which we use a laser light source to essentially almost destroy the hair follicle,&#8221; says Carlos A. Charles, MD, a board-certified dermatologist and the founder of&nbsp;Derma di Colore. Laser hair removal works by targeting a specific medium, such as melanin, pigment, or a hair follicle, he explains. &#8220;In the case of doing laser hair removal, primarily the type that we do in darker skin, the laser goes after melanin or pigment at the bulb of the hair.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although laser hair removal has been found to drastically reduce hair growth, &#8220;It&#8217;s important to emphasize that laser hair removal is really like permanent hair reduction—it&#8217;s not going to get rid of everything,&#8221; says Dr. Charles. In other words, it will diminish the amount of hair you have, but it may not remove it all for good.</p>



<p>Up until recently, laser hair removal wasn&#8217;t considered safe for people with melanin-rich skin because early models of lasers weren&#8217;t created to differentiate the melanin in the skin from the melanin of the hair follicle. Because of this, people with darker complexions were at an increased risk of experiencing burns, scarring, hypopigmentation (aka light spots on your skin), and other adverse reactions when treated with a laser. However, with new lasers created with melanin-rich skin in mind, specifically&nbsp;lasers with longer wavelengths, longer pulse durations, and more efficient cooling devices, this is changing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The benefits of laser hair removal</h2>



<p>Not only does laser hair removal reduce unwanted hair on the body, but as a result, it can also be used to treat common skin concerns such as&nbsp;razor bumps,&nbsp;hyperpigmentation&nbsp;(darkened areas of skin), and hypopigmentation. Because the laser targets the hair follicle and reduces hair growth, it prevents the follicle from becoming inflamed. Plus, as the hair on your body decreases, it eliminates the need for shaving, which is often the culprit behind razor bumps and the dark patches associated with them. For those who have discoloration or bumps caused by hair growth, over time laser hair removal may also improve the texture of your skin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The best laser for dark complexions</h2>



<p>If you tried to get laser hair removal on a darker complexion in the early 2000s, you were probably turned away because old lasers weren&#8217;t created to work on these skin types. But now, newer lasers can distinguish between the pigment of the skin and hair follicles, making it possible to safely and effectively treat melanin-rich skin.</p>



<p>According to Dr. Charles, laser hair removal is &#8220;incredibly effective&#8221; for people with darker complexions when performed with a laser that provides a 1064 nanometer laser wavelength of light. Lasers such as the Nd:YAG have a 1064 nanometer wavelength, and this long wavelength&nbsp;bypasses the melanin found in the skin&nbsp;and solely targets the melanin, or pigment, of the hair follicle.</p>



<p>&#8220;This particular wavelength is safest for skin of color because the wavelength penetrates the skin deeply enough to destroy the hair follicles without destroying the surrounding melanocytes [which are the cells in your skin that produce pigment],&#8221; says&nbsp;DiAnne Davis, MD, FAAD, a board-certified cosmetic dermatologist located in Dallas, TX. This is important because the destruction of the melanocytes can lead to pigmentary alterations such as hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, she adds.</p>



<p>According to Dr. Charles, laser hair removal is very safe with minimal side effects, &#8220;assuming that the person doing it is using the right laser and understands the mechanics of treating darker skin,&#8221; he says.</p>



<p>The biggest issue when performing laser hair removal on dark skin comes from the heat that the lasers produce, says Dr. Charles. The intensity of the heat can potentially heat up melanin and harm the skin, leading to pigment changes like post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. This is why it&#8217;s imperative to use a laser that will solely target the pigmentation of the hair follicle and not your skin, and get services from people who have experience working with skin of color.</p>



<p>When looking for a provider, &#8220;The brand of the laser is not as important as the specific wavelength of the laser,&#8221; says Dr. Davis. Instead of simply booking a session at the location your favorite celebs frequent or your friends swear by, make sure first and foremost they have a laser that’s safe for your skin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Good candidates for laser hair removal</h2>



<p>Before you invest in laser hair removal it&#8217;s important to find out if you&#8217;re a good candidate to receive treatment. According to Dr. Charles, no matter the amount of melanin in your skin or how light or dark your complexion is, you can get laser hair removal. &#8220;But the people that tend to do the best have coarse, thick hair and darker hair, and that&#8217;s because the light source in the laser tends to see that hair the best, so it picks up the hair and it really zaps it,&#8221; he says.</p>



<p>People with dark brown or black hair tend to see the best results with laser, adds Dr. Davis. If you have light brown, grey, or white hair, unfortunately, you aren&#8217;t considered a good candidate for laser hair removal as the laser won&#8217;t be able to detect the melanin of the hair follicles.</p>



<p>Most people will see success with laser hair removal, but there are areas, such as the upper lip, which are harder to treat because that hair tends to be finer. Most professionals will still treat this spot, but because it tends to be resistant to treatment (and because excess hair growth in the area can sometimes be caused by hormones), you may not see drastic results and will likely need to do multiple sessions to see any results at all.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Things to keep in mind before your first laser hair removal treatment</h2>



<p>There are a few things you&#8217;ll want to be aware of before you book your initial session. First, you&#8217;ll want to take stock of your skin-care routine and consult your dermatologist or laser provider. If you use products that contain ingredients like salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide on areas you plan on getting treated, professionals may recommend you stop using them altogether, or at least press pause on them for a few days before and after your treatment. According to Dr. Davis, this is because they can cause increased sensitivity of the skin and in conjunction with laser hair removal, you run the risk of irritation or more serious issues such as your skin peeling off and scarring.</p>



<p>Dr. Charles doesn&#8217;t stop his patients from using topicals on treatment areas, but he doesn’t recommend using retinol or retinoids immediately after getting treated. “That said, it is ok to start your skin-care regimen a couple of days after treatment assuming that all went well with the treatment,” he says. For those on&nbsp;Accutane, Dr. Charles doesn’t recommend getting treatment, as the skin can respond unpredictably.</p>



<p>And if you&#8217;re pregnant, it&#8217;s also advised that you hold off on treatment, as studies haven&#8217;t evaluated the safety of laser hair removal during pregnancy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to prepare for a laser hair removal session</h2>



<p>&#8220;Before your laser hair removal appointment, you will want to have a consultation with your board-certified dermatologist to review your medical history and discuss goals you want to achieve so you can be fully educated on exactly how the treatments will work,&#8221; says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>Before purchasing any sessions, I highly recommend setting up an appointment to spot test the areas you want to get laser on. First, you&#8217;ll be able to get a feel for the practice and whether or not you like it and your provider, and most importantly, you&#8217;ll be able to find out if you&#8217;ll have any adverse effects to the treatment. My biggest fear was getting burned on my vagina and having permanent scars (and wasting my money), so in my opinion, it&#8217;s worth the caution and extra appointment.</p>



<p>&#8220;Avoid waxing, avoid plucking, avoid electrolysis to the area [being treated] for at least three or four weeks&#8221; prior to your sessions, adds Dr. Charles. But if you&#8217;re adamant about removing hair in between sessions, &#8220;shaving is the best thing to do,&#8221; he says.</p>



<p>You’ll want to avoid waxing, as it removes the entire hair follicle, and in order for the laser to work, you need a little bit of hair as the laser detects the pigment of the hair follicle. Most providers recommend shaving a day or two before your session for best results, but this varies by technician and location, so make sure to speak with your provider to find out their specific recommendations and guidelines.</p>



<p>In my experience, shaving two days prior to your session is the best, especially if you always miss patches of hair. I find that the first shave gets most of the hair and the second shave allows you to go over any spots you initially missed. Worst case scenario, your provider will shave any missed areas before the fun begins.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect during your laser hair removal session</h2>



<p>For those who have begun their research, you&#8217;ve probably heard laser hair removal providers or friends who have gone through with it say that it&#8217;s painless. And to that, I call BS, respectfully. While we all have different pain tolerance levels, I think it&#8217;s safe to say that laser removal is uncomfortable. In my opinion, it feels like heated rubber bands getting snapped against your skin. I know that description sounds horrible, but the silver lining is that the discomfort only lasts for a split second.</p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t gotten laser all over my body, but can attest that there are definitely areas that are way more sensitive than others. For example, the vulva. There are no words to describe what that feels like, and I recommend going to your happy place, taking deep breaths, and squeezing the shit out of the stress balls.</p>



<p>To help manage the discomfort of getting a full Brazilian, I like to use&nbsp;numbing cream&nbsp;($17). I apply it about an hour before I need to leave home, let it stay on for at least 20 minutes (the longer the better), and it drastically reduces any discomfort. That said, I recommend speaking with your provider to see what products they do and don&#8217;t recommend.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, you will more than likely experience some level of discomfort, and instead of abiding by the &#8220;suck it up&#8221; mentality, let your provider know so that they can give you a break or decrease the intensity of the laser.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect after a laser hair removal session</h2>



<p>After your session, you may experience minor bumps on your skin due to inflammation of the hair follicles, &#8220;but those typically go away within a day or so,&#8221; says Dr. Charles. He adds that redness is also common, and he tends to give people a mild topical steroid to use for a few days following the session in order to reduce it. Speaking from personal experience, providers typically offer&nbsp;aloe vera gel to soothe the skin&nbsp;immediately after performing treatment on each area.</p>



<p>You should avoid sun exposure and use&nbsp;sunscreen or moisturizer with SPF&nbsp;to prevent burning, as your skin will be more photosensitive than normal. This is because the laser has damaged the hair follicle which can initially cause redness and irritation to the treated area, similar to when you get a skin-care treatment on your face, making you more susceptible to damage from UV rays.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How long does it take to see results from laser hair removal</h2>



<p>After feeling like you&#8217;ve been popped with thousands of rubber bands, you may be wondering how long it will take to see results. &#8220;You&#8217;ll typically see anywhere between a 50 percent and 90 percent reduction of hair with the first treatment,&#8221; says Dr. Charles, adding that it usually takes around five sessions to see major differences.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t believe this was true until I started experiencing moments where 20 to 30 pieces of &#8220;dead&#8221; hair would fall out onto my washcloth as I washed my body and into my hands as I applied lotion. This may seem odd at first, but it&#8217;s a good indicator that your sessions are working and aren&#8217;t being done in vain.</p>



<p>You should also expect to see less hair growth after a few sessions. At times, it may look patchy, because your hair grows in different phases and some areas tend to be more stubborn than others. &#8220;It is important to adhere to a consistent, monthly routine when starting laser hair removal,&#8221; says Dr. Charles. This is because your hair typically grows in three phases: the growth phase, the resting phase, and the regression phase.</p>



<p>&#8220;Different portions of the hair will enter a growth phase at different time points after the laser hair removal treatment, while other areas will be in a resting or regression phase. Therefore, it is crucial for the success of the treatments to follow up with monthly treatments to capture new areas undergoing growth,&#8221; says Dr. Charles. And although this is anecdotal, I&#8217;ve found from my own experience that being consistent with your sessions reduces the level of pain from treatment to treatment.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth mentioning again that though laser treatments can make a big difference in the amount of hair on your body, it&#8217;s not considered permanent hair removal. Because factors like hormones can continue to impact your hair growth, you&#8217;ll still need to go in for maintenance sessions even after you&#8217;re &#8220;done.&#8221;</p>



<p>With all of that said, laser hair removal is definitely a time, emotional, and financial commitment, so before you book a session, make sure that you’re confident in the provider and ready to commit to at least six months of consistent treatment.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Permanent Hair Removal At Home </h2>



<p>Hair grows all over the body, including the face, arms, and legs. Although hair growth is normal for both males and females, some people may wish to remove hair permanently for cosmetic reasons.</p>



<p>Areas of the body on which people commonly undergo long-term hair removal procedures include the:</p>



<ul>
<li>legs</li>



<li>arms</li>



<li>groin</li>



<li>underarms</li>



<li>face</li>
</ul>



<p>Although some methods of hair removal provide results that last for months or years, few methods are truly permanent.</p>



<p>In this article, we look at treatments that people can try for long-term results and at-home methods of hair removal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can you remove hair permanently?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are a few long-term hair removal options for people looking to get rid of unwanted hair. The only treatment that the&nbsp;Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Trusted Source&nbsp;describe as permanent is electrolysis.</p>



<p>Another method of hair removal that provides long lasting results is laser hair removal. However, some people need touch-up sessions to maintain the results. These tend to be necessary, for instance, for females who undergo laser hair removal on&nbsp;the face.<a href="https://yahoo.com/"></a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Electrolysis</h2>



<p>A technician will perform electrolysis by using needles to apply short wave radio frequencies to the hair follicles to destroy them. They will then remove the hair with tweezers.</p>



<p>A technician can perform electrolysis on nearly any part of the body. Electrolysis also works on any type of hair, including light-colored hair.</p>



<p>Due to the growth cycle of hair, a person typically requires multiple sessions of electrolysis to achieve the desired effects. The number of sessions can vary depending on the area of the body, the sensitivity of the person, and the amount of hair present.</p>



<p>However, once the technician has removed all of the hair from the specified area, a person will not require any additional appointments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Side effects</h3>



<p>After electrolysis sessions, a person may experience stinging, redness, or irritation at the site of the hair removal. They may also develop an infection or excessive scar tissue around the site, but this is rare.</p>



<p>Some at-home electrolysis kits are available. However, the&nbsp;American Academy of Dermatology (AAD)&nbsp;recommend that an experienced technician perform electrolysis for the best results.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cost</h3>



<p>The cost of electrolysis varies depending on the number of sessions, as well as several other factors, such as the skill level of the technician and how much hair needs removing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Laser hair removal</h2>



<p>Laser hair removal involves the use of a high-heat laser to destroy the hair follicle. A technician can use laser hair removal anywhere on the body, except for the area around the eyes.</p>



<p>According to the&nbsp;AAD, a person can expect to see a 10–25% reduction in hair after the first session. When the hairs do grow back, they tend to be a lighter color and less thick. Once the hair has stopped growing, it may not return for months or years.</p>



<p>Laser hair removal&nbsp;works best&nbsp;on hair that is dark and coarse. It is not effective for light, gray, or red hair.</p>



<p>Laser hair removal usually requires a course of multiple sessions to remove all of the hair from a specific area of the body. These sessions will take place&nbsp;4–6 weeks&nbsp;apart.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Side effects</h3>



<p>Laser hair removal does have some risks, especially if an inexperienced or poorly trained technician performs it. The laser can cause some minor pain and discomfort during the procedure.</p>



<p>Following the treatment, a person’s skin may become red or irritated for a few days. Rarely, blisters or scarring may occur at the site of the hair removal.</p>



<p>Laser hair removal makes the skin temporarily more sensitive to sunlight. It is important that people undergoing laser hair removal protect their skin from the sun during their course of treatment. They can do this by:</p>



<ul>
<li>avoiding direct sunlight exposure</li>



<li>refraining from using tanning beds</li>



<li>wearing sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF)</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cost</h3>



<p>Each session of laser hair removal costs&nbsp;$285, on average. As with electrolysis, the price will vary depending on the technician, geographic location, size of the treatment area, and number of sessions necessary.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prescription-strength creams</h2>



<p>Prescription-strength creams are available for hair removal. They may be a better option for people who wish to avoid the higher costs of laser hair removal or electrolysis.</p>



<p>A hair removal cream called eflornithine (Vaniqa) can suppress hair growth when a person uses it regularly. The&nbsp;FDA&nbsp;reported in 2000 that Vaniqa is generally safe to use for the removal of unwanted facial hair.</p>



<p>To use eflornithine, a person should follow the advice of their doctor. In general, they will need to apply the cream twice a day.</p>



<p>Following the application, a person should not wash the treated areas for about&nbsp;4 hours&nbsp;to give the cream time to take effect.</p>



<p>Although eflornithine is generally safe, a person may react to the cream. Pregnant women should talk to their doctor before using the cream. If a reaction does occur, a person should discontinue use and talk to their doctor as soon as possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to remove hair at home&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There is no way to remove hair permanently at home. However, it may be possible to permanently or semipermanently reduce hair growth.</p>



<p>According to one&nbsp;studyTrusted Source,&nbsp;intense pulsed light (IPL)&nbsp;devices designed for at-home use are safe, and if a person uses them regularly, they are effective for hair removal.</p>



<p>Some inexpensive but short-term methods of hair removal include:</p>



<ul>
<li>
<strong>Shaving:</strong>&nbsp;This method cuts the visible hair off at the skin’s surface. However, the results are short-term, and the hair will grow back within a few days.</li>



<li>
<strong>Waxing:</strong>&nbsp;Waxing involves the use of hot wax or wax strips to stick to body hair and pull it out. A person can perform waxing at home using waxing kits.</li>



<li>
<strong>Tweezing:</strong>&nbsp;Using tweezers to pull hairs out of the skin can be painful, but this technique provides slightly longer lasting results than shaving.</li>



<li>
<strong>Creams or ointments:</strong>&nbsp;Some over-the-counter creams or ointments can remove hair temporarily, but they can cause skin reactions in some people.</li>
</ul>



<p>Similarly to professional treatments, each at-home hair removal solution has associated risks. These include:</p>



<ul>
<li>irritation at the site of hair removal</li>



<li>razor burn</li>



<li>chemical burns</li>



<li>allergic reactions</li>



<li>ingrown hairs</li>



<li>rash or redness</li>



<li>infection</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to see a doctor&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A person should talk to their doctor if hair removal leads to side effects, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>signs of an infection, which may include swelling or&nbsp;pus</li>



<li>excessive scar tissue</li>



<li>a skin rash that does not go away</li>
</ul>



<p>A person should also talk to a dermatologist if they want to try a longer lasting solution to hair removal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Summary</h2>



<p>Permanent hair removal is possible, but it is often expensive. Electrolysis provides permanent results. In contrast, the results of laser hair removal are long lasting but not always permanent.</p>



<p>Health insurance does not typically cover the cost of these procedures. Some cheaper options, such as at-home IPL kits and prescription-strength creams, provide semipermanent hair removal without as much expense.</p>



<p>If a person does want to remove hair permanently, it is important that they seek the advice and expertise of an experienced dermatologist or technician.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0">Out of all the&nbsp;hair-removal options&nbsp;out there, lasers sound the most appealing… in theory. A few zaps and you’ll never have to touch a razor again? Sounds great, and there’s a reason 1&nbsp;<em>million</em>&nbsp;people underwent the procedure in 2018, according to a report by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;But then there’s the not-so-appealing part: the price tag. One session of laser hair removal can cost hundreds of dollars, and some people will need almost a dozen sessions to reduce their hair. Yikes.&nbsp;Enter:&nbsp;at-home laser hair removal.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-2"><strong>If the thought of zapping yourself with lasers sounds scary, keep reading—we’re sharing everything you could ever want to know about this high-tech at-home hair-removal innovation.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-4">What is it?</h2>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-5">Laser hair removal works like this: After a laser is aimed at your hair, the pigment in your hair follicles absorbs the light and is subsequently destroyed. At-home laser hair works in the same way—a futuristic-looking device emits a laser pulse that targets your hair follicle, heats it up, and prevents it from growing new hair.&nbsp;The Tria&nbsp;Hair Removal 4X&nbsp;($469) is the first FDA-cleared at-home hair-removal laser that uses a diode laser (the same ones a derm would use if you went in for an in-office treatment), according to the brand.</p>



<p>Other at-home laser kits like the&nbsp;RoseSkinCo IPL Laser Hair Removal Handset&nbsp;($130) promise permanent hair reduction after three treatments and are great for both large and small areas of hair removal. Another at-home option, the&nbsp;Silk’n Infinity Hair Removal Device&nbsp;($319), uses home pulsed light (aka HPL)&nbsp;technology, which the company says is superior to lasers and IPL&nbsp;because of its wide spectrum of&nbsp;wavelengths, larger spot size, and lower pain levels.</p>
