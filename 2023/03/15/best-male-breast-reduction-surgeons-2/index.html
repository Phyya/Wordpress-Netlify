<p>During this outpatient procedure, your surgeon makes an incision around the areola. This allows him or her to remove excess fat and skin from underneath your breasts. The surgeon then removes excess skin from above the muscle of each breast to achieve a more natural look. The procedure may be performed under general anesthesia or local anesthesia with sedation if you have an allergy to anesthesia or if you have had previous surgeries on your chest area. You will likely need stitches after surgery; these should be removed within 7 to 10 days after surgery.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img post-id="9012" fifu-featured="1" decoding="async" src="https://cosmeticsurgerytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-976.png" alt="Best Male Breast Reduction Surgeons" title="Best Male Breast Reduction Surgeons" class="wp-image-121337"></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Male Breast Reduction Surgeons</h2>



<p>A male breast reduction is the most effective known treatment for gynecomastia, or enlarged male breasts. This cosmetic surgery procedure removes excess fat and glandular tissue to restore a flatter, firmer and more masculine contour&nbsp;to the chest.</p>



<p>Due to genetics, use of certain medications, or other unspecified reasons, some men&nbsp;develop&nbsp;the appearance of enlarged breasts. It is estimated that up to 50% of men in the United States experience some degree of gynecomastia during their lifetime. Gynecomastia can present at any age, and male breast reduction can be performed safely and successfully on teenagers and adult men alike.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why have a male breast reduction?</h4>



<p>While losing weight can help reduce the appearance of male breasts for some men, often times there is excess glandular tissue as well, causing&nbsp;even very lean patients to notice enlarged breasts. Currently, male breast reduction is the only consistently effective treatment for gynecomastia that has long lasting, if not permanent, results. Following this surgery, patients&nbsp;commonly say they feel comfortable going shirtless for the first time in years, and report an enhanced sense of self-confidence.</p>



<p>If you are uncomfortable or self-conscious about the appearance of your chest, or if you find yourself avoiding certain activities because you are afraid to show your chest, male breast reduction is an option to consider. With the help of a qualified cosmetic surgeon, the procedure offers dramatic, near immediate improvements with minimal scarring.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choosing&nbsp;a Qualified Cosmetic Surgeon</h2>



<p>Male breast reduction is one of the more&nbsp;straightforward cosmetic surgery procedures, but excellent results require a skilled approach that can only come from specialized training and experience. You need to vet potential doctors carefully to find a cosmetic surgeon who can perform the procedure&nbsp;safely and achieve&nbsp;the results you desire. Pay&nbsp;attention to 3&nbsp;key factors when choosing a cosmetic surgeon for your male breast reduction procedure:</p>



<ul>
<li>
<strong>Skill &amp; Experience:</strong>&nbsp;make sure your cosmetic surgeon regularly performs male breast reduction as part of his or her practice. Ask how many procedures he or she has done, ask to see pictures of prior patients, and make sure you like what you see—this indicates that a cosmetic surgeon’s aesthetic style aligns well with yours.</li>



<li>
<strong>Board Certification in Cosmetic Surgery:</strong>&nbsp;ABCS&nbsp;board certified cosmetic surgeons&nbsp;are fellowship trained in all areas of cosmetic surgery, including liposuction and chest contouring, which&nbsp;may not be covered in plastic surgery or other surgical residencies.&nbsp;Also, by choosing a board certified cosmetic surgeon, you can take comfort in knowing your procedure will be performed in an&nbsp;accredited surgery center.</li>



<li>
<strong>Your Rapport with a Cosmetic Surgeon:</strong>&nbsp;you need to feel comfortable&nbsp;being candid with a cosmetic surgeon about your concerns and your medical history.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Treating Gynecomastia with Liposuction</h4>



<p>Today, cosmetic surgeons are able to treat a growing number of gynecomastia patients using liposuction. This is due in part to advances in liposuction technology, which have resulted in a wider selection of less&nbsp;invasive techniques. However, surgeon skill plays an important role too, and it is important to choose a cosmetic surgeon who is trained in liposuction and has specific experience performing male breast reduction using liposuction.&nbsp;Learn more about liposuction surgery &amp; techniques.</p>



<p>The procedure for treating gynecomastia with liposuction is typically&nbsp;performed using local anesthesia with sedation or general anesthesia, and involves a small incision&nbsp;on each side of the chest. Depending on your needs and your cosmetic surgeon’s preferred technique, incisions may be&nbsp;located along a portion of the edge of the areola or within the armpit. Through these incisions, your cosmetic surgeon will remove excess fat and/or glandular tissue, at the same time sculpting a new chest contour that looks natural to your body.</p>



<p>This patient had liposuction to treat gynecomastia and reduce lovehandles.</p>



<p>The recovery process following liposuction is typically quite tolerable. Patients are often given a compression garment to wear for the first few weeks after surgery; this helps to minimize swelling and offers support to the healing tissues. While vigorous exercise is typically off-limits for about 3 weeks, many men return to work or school within several days after their procedures. However, it is important to understand that everyone heals at a unique pace; your cosmetic surgeon will give you individualized instructions for recovery.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Male Breast Reduction with Tissue Excision</h4>



<p>More severe cases of gynecomastia may require surgical tissue excision to achieve optimal results. Additionally, patients who have stretched, sagging skin around the breasts will usually require this approach. Tissue excisions allows a cosmetic surgeon to remove a greater amount of glandular tissue and/or skin that cannot be successfully treated with liposuction alone.</p>



<p>The location and length of the incisions depends on the extent of surgery needed, but are typically located around the edge of the areola (peri-areolar incision) or within the natural creases of the chest. A&nbsp;trained, qualified&nbsp;cosmetic surgeon will take care to place incisions so that the resulting scars are as inconspicuous as possible.</p>



<p>Male breast reduction with tissue excision is typically performed as an outpatient procedure using general anesthesia or local anesthesia with sedation.&nbsp;The recovery process is similar to that for liposuction; however, it is common for patients to experience soreness and some swelling. Typically, patients feel ready to return to work within 1 week of surgery, and a gradual return to exercise is usually permitted after the first couple of weeks.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Life After Male Breast Reduction</h4>



<p>After gynecomastia surgery, you should&nbsp;notice an immediate improvement in the shape and appearance of your chest. While you may feel sore for a few days, pain is usually minimal. &nbsp;While your cosmetic surgeon will likely prescribe some pain medication, many men find that over-the-counter options, such as Tylenol, is sufficient.&nbsp;If you are given a compression garment, wear it. This will enhance your comfort and help your chest&nbsp;heal optimally.</p>



<p>While every patient’s healing process is unique,&nbsp;most patients feel ready to return to work just a few days after a male breast reduction, depending on the nature of their work.&nbsp;Some men experience a loss of sensation in the treated areas after a male breast reduction, but this is almost always temporary. Any loss of sensation should gradually return over the months following your procedure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Maintaining Your Improved Chest Contour</h3>



<p>Male breast reduction results are meant to be permanent – the excess fat, glandular tissue and skin removed are gone for good. However, it’s important to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Significant weight gain, steroid use, or certain medical conditions could result in a recurrence of gynecomastia. Additionally, drugs&nbsp;that influence&nbsp;testosterone levels could also affect your results.&nbsp;An experienced, board certified cosmetic surgeon can help you learn what to do to maintain your results for the long term.</p>



<p>If you are suffering from gynecomastia, male breast reduction could be the right solution to&nbsp;correct this condition and help you feel more confident in your appearance.&nbsp;The best way to learn about your options is to consult with a qualified&nbsp;cosmetic surgeon.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Recovery After Breast Augmentation Surgery</h2>



<p>Breast augmentation, also called augmentation mammoplasty or casually referred to as “boob job” is a quick elective surgery to increase the size or the fullness of the breasts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a lot of reasons why women opt for breast augmentation surgery. Whether you have an uneven volume of fat in your breast area, are dissatisfied with the size of your breasts, or need a lift after breastfeeding, it all comes down to bringing confidence back.</p>



<p>Despite being cosmetic in nature, breast augmentation surgery is still a major operation. Assisting your body and applying the best practices for recovery will help your breasts heal without complications. You must work hand in hand with your surgeon and equip yourself with as much knowledge as you can to take care of yourself pre and post surgery.</p>



<p>Here’s everything that you can expect during the recovery period.</p>



<p><strong>Post-Operation</strong></p>



<p>After the operation, here are some things you need to consider:</p>



<ul>
<li>When you wake up after the procedure, you might feel loopy and funny because of the pain medicine and anesthesia. While you are able to make minimal movements, you can’t drive yourself home or participate in any activity that will require mental focus. Make sure that you will be assisted by at least 1 caretaker who will take you home and assist you post surgery.</li>



<li>As far as pain goes, you will feel more discomfort than pain since you will be given numbing creams and painkillers that will last you a while. It’s exactly why you might feel funny for as long as the medicine is in your system.</li>



<li>Your surgeon will recommend you wear a supportive bra while in recovery (ideally for around 6 months). A surgical bra may be provided, but high-impact sports bras or compression bras will work just fine. Make sure to choose bras that open from the front so as not to strain your arms. You will not be able to do much with them during the first few days after the operation.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Avoid straining your chest area by refraining from lifting heavy objects and wearing inappropriate bras. Keep the surgical bra on for support and as much as possible, avoid bralettes and wire bras for up to 6 months.&nbsp;</li>



<li>It is normal to experience bruising and swelling around your breast area post-op. Feeling tightness is also a common feeling for the first 2 days. Cold therapy by using&nbsp;gel packs or clay packs&nbsp;will definitely help calm the soreness.</li>



<li>You will not be able to shower on your own because you cannot stretch your arms from the surgery. Your stitches can also be infected when it gets wet so request for waterproof tape to cover your stitches until your next doctor’s visit. Alternatively, ask for assistance whenever you’re washing your body or your hair.</li>



<li>Light walking is highly recommended to help with blood circulation, thus preventing any blood clots from forming.</li>



<li>Drinking loads of water can help with flushing out the anesthesia post-op. As you take pain medication during your recovery period, remember that these meds can cause constipation so drinking a lot of water helps prevent that.</li>



<li>While pain, discomfort, swelling, and bruising are completely normal, you must go to the doctor if you get fever as this could be a sign of an infection.</li>



<li>You have to sleep on our back during the whole duration of your recovery period. Sleeping on your chest or sides can put pressure on your implants and stitches, and can cause an infection. You’ll have to sleep on your back for a while and wait for the green light from your doctor before you can sleep on your sides or chest (in some cases, it can take a full year).</li>



<li>Use supporting pillows to make you comfortable, and when you catch yourself sleeping on your side, immediately correct your position. If you’re someone who’s used to sleeping on your stomach or side, this position will take a little getting used to.</li>



<li>If you’re reading this before your surgery, practice sleeping on your back as early as you can. It will be one less thing to worry about once you’re home after surgery. This will also ensure that you will get the right amount of sleep to help you recover fast.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>1 Week Post-Op</strong></p>



<p>The day after your surgery isn’t all that bad since there’s still anesthesia in your system. The days following that, however, have been regarded as the worst part of the recovery process. But don’t fret &#8211; it will only last a week.</p>



<ul>
<li>Aside from the discomfort, there have been cases where women report experiencing postoperative depression. Some women need an adjustment period to get used to the look of their new breasts, and others report brief moments of doubt with their decision to get the surgery. If you ever experience symptoms like low mood, fatigue, change in appetite, a loss of interest, irritability, and other symptoms of depression, know that it is normal. Post-surgical depression can last for a couple of days up to a month.</li>



<li>During these times, it is important to reach out for help and support. This is also the time to take care of yourself even more by eating healthy and being active (but not too active).&nbsp;</li>



<li>Given that the implants have not completely settled or are still swollen, women might feel like they chose the wrong size or regret the procedure altogether. The look of your breasts will improve as it “drops and fluffs,” (a process that takes 6 months) finally settling into its intended position once the muscles in your breast relax.</li>



<li>You will not be completely helpless but you might need a designated caretaker to assist you with menial tasks from time to time.&nbsp;</li>



<li>You can go back to work 2-4 days after your surgery, but you can not do any heavy lifting or anything too strenuous.</li>



<li>As for the pain and swelling, you might still feel stinging or discomfort since your skin and nerves are being stretched because of your implant. Your nipples might experience pain or numbness. You might also notice stretch marks forming, so you can apply moisturizer or oil to help reduce its appearance.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>1 Month Post-Op</strong></p>



<p>By this time, you’re most likely used to your new boobs and might not feel as much pain and discomfort, except for the occasional random pains and pulls. However, there are some things you still have to remember.</p>



<ul>
<li>Your stitches have been around long enough for them to accumulate moisture and dirt, so make sure to clean them thoroughly to avoid infection.</li>



<li>After the one month mark, you can already start with light exercise if you’ve been exercising before your surgery. 6 weeks is the prescribed time until you can fully return to your normal function, but you will still be restricted from using weights that weigh more than 10 pounds.</li>



<li>You might experience what’s called a “morning boob,” which manifests as a tightness and hardness in your breasts for the first 30 minutes when you wake up. This is nothing to worry about and is completely normal.</li>



<li>Morning boob is due to muscle spasm. During your sleep, you don’t move your arms around very much and so your pecs (pectoralis muscles located in your chest) are not engaged. Since your pecs have not been fully accustomed to the implants, it tries to return to its unstretched state. Thus, your breasts might feel tight when you wake up. After a few light movements, the discomfort disappears altogether.</li>
</ul>



<p>At this stage, you need to be aware of capsular contracture. Capsular contracture is a breast augmentation complication which happens when the scar tissue or ‘capsule’ that naturally develops around your implant squeezes or chokes the implants. This is an immune system response and it can happen as early as a month after your surgery or even years after.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Capsular contracture develops gradually. It starts out normal and the first sign is usually a high-riding breast/s. After that, pain and firmness may be felt around your implants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you already know, your implants are supposed to drop to its intended position but if you notice that they are doing the exact opposite, you should consult a doctor immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The degree of capsular contracture is graded using the&nbsp;four-grade&nbsp;<strong>Baker scale</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Grade 1: The breasts are normal, soft, and appears natural</li>



<li>Grade 2: The breasts are a little firm, but appears natural and normal</li>



<li>Grade 3: The breasts are firm and appears high-riding or unnatural</li>



<li>Grade 4: The breasts are hard, appears high-riding or unnatural, and is painful to the touch</li>
</ul>



<p>Your risk of getting capsular contracture increases when you get an infection, hematoma (collection of blood outside a blood vessel), or seroma (fluid build-up under the surface of the skin).</p>



<p>It is important to call your doctor immediately when you feel like something is wrong with your implants. The most effective treatment of capsular contracture is by removing the scar tissue/capsule surrounding your implants, or by removing or replacing&nbsp; your implants.</p>



<p><strong>6 Months Post Op</strong></p>



<p>After 6 months, your breasts are considered fully healed. You can now go back to your normal activities and enjoy your new breasts. Still, keep these few things in mind:</p>



<ul>
<li>You need to still sleep on your back until you get a green light from your surgeon to avoid putting pressure on your implant or your stitches.</li>



<li>6 months after the surgery is also when the “drop and fluff” process is completed. When the drop and fluff process ends, your pectoral muscles relax, the implants drop to their final place, and fluff out into the space where they should be.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Numbness especially around your nipples is completely normal. Unfortunately, the numbing can last up to two years for some people.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>



<p>Recovery after breast augmentation needs to be slow and steady. For your stitches to fully heal and for your implants to beautifully settle, you need to support your body’s natural healing process. Use supportive bras for as long as necessary, avoid infection by taking care of your stitches and protecting your implants, and tend to your pain.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Male Breast Reduction Without Surgery</h2>



<p>Male breast reduction surgery is a procedure to remove excess fat, glandular tissue and skin from the male chest. During this procedure, a plastic surgeon will perform liposuction to remove the fat, and then use an excision to remove excess skin and glandular tissue.</p>



<p>This procedure is also known as gynecomastia or maestroplasty. It’s often done when men have enlarged breasts, but it can also be done for cosmetic reasons if you are unhappy with your chest size.</p>



<p>Male breast reduction without surgery can be achieved through exercise, dieting and other non-surgical techniques.</p>



<p>If you have enlarged male breasts that don’t fit your body type or if you have been teased about having man boobs, then male breast reduction without surgery may be right for you.</p>



<p>Male breast reduction is a cosmetic surgery procedure designed to remove excess fat, skin, and glandular tissue from the male chest. It is commonly performed on men who are physically fit and well-muscled but have some excess skin that hangs from the chest area.</p>



<p>Unlike women, men don&#8217;t have a lot of fat in their breasts, but they do have glandular tissue that produces milk for their children. The amount of glandular tissue varies from person to person. Some men have very little or no glandular tissue in their breasts while others may have more than average.</p>



<p>Male breast reduction can be performed using one of two techniques: liposuction or surgery. Liposuction is an outpatient procedure where a tube is inserted into the fat layer under the skin of your chest and then used to suction out excess fat cells through small incisions made around your nipple area. The benefit of this technique is that it can be performed quickly with little recovery time needed afterward. However, liposuction doesn&#8217;t correct any loose skin, so if you&#8217;re seeking a complete correction then surgical intervention may be necessary.</p>



<p>Surgical intervention requires an incision be made around each nipple followed by removal of excess skin through this area as well as removal of any excess glandular tissue</p>
